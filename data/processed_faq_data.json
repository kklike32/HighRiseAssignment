Your post will now be pinned to the top of your profile for all to see.  Want to unpin it? Follow the same steps, but choose 'unpin'!

Creations: Fancy pinning some of your best work? No worries, you'll be able to pin Assets, Worlds, and Rooms you've created to show off to everyone on Highrise.

Common Questions: How do I know if something has been Pinned? After you pin an item, we'll give you a little message for confirmation and then add a pin icon üìå onto whatever is pinned to let you and any onlookers know. Can I organize my Pins? You can't organize pins; whatever your most recent Pin is will show above all the rest and become king üëë. Is there a limit to the number of things that can be Pinned? Currently, you can pin up to 64 items. We hope this generous limit helps you flaunt your awesomeness to the fullest!",

        "content": "Grab Swapping What is Grab swapping? The Grab Swapping feature allows you to exchange items you've won from a Grab for a chance to receive a different item from a rarity-based loot table. This gives you a second opportunity to potentially improve the value of your prizes and helps reduce duplicates in your inventory. How do I know my chances of winning an item from the loot table? We've introduced a dedicated screen displaying explicit probabilities for winning each item within a Grab, not just on the Grab Swapping loot table, but all on all Grabs. This ensures transparency and helps you make informed decisions when participating in Grabs. How does the swapping process work? To swap an item, you'll need to select it for swapping. After holding the Swap button for 3 seconds, the swapping sequence begins. The item will spin and, upon tapping, will reveal the new item you've received in exchange. If I swap my items, will I lose my progress in a grab? Nope! You'll retain your progress. Completion and Progress rewards are based on the initial winnings. Rewards are given after pressing \"Got it,\" even if you swap the item later. So feel free to swap them if you want! How can I see which items are swappable? Items eligible for swapping will have a \"Swappable\" label on the banner of Grabs that include this feature. This label is visible both on the Grab screen and in the Store. This new feature aims to enhance your experience by providing more flexibility and opportunities to improve your collection. Happy swapping! Do I Have to Swap My Items Immediately When I Win Them? You do not have to swap your items immediately after winning them. As long as the grab is up, you'll be able to swap your items from that grab. However, when the grab expires you will no longer be able to swap items from that grab.",

Whether you're a new user or a long-time member, OOTD offers a fresh way to engage with daily goals, discover new items, and share your unique looks with the community. How do I access the OOTD feature? You can find the OOTD feature under your Daily Goals. Look for a goal labeled \"Outfit of the Day\" and hit the \"Go\" button to start. Do I use my own items for the OOTD? No, the special OOTD closet provides a unique selection of items that are not from your personal collection. This allows you to experiment with styles and pieces you might not own yet. Get creative and have a blast! Can I save the outfits I create with the OOTD feature? The looks you create with OOTD are just for fun and cannot be saved to your avatar or personal closet. However, you're encouraged to take a picture of your creation to share on social media or within our community. Will I receive any rewards for participating in the OOTD? Yes, completing the OOTD daily goal will grant you rewards. The type and amount of rewards can vary, so be sure to check the details when you participate. How can I share my OOTD creations? After creating your look, you'll have the option to take a picture and share it on social media or on Highris. Use the daily hashtag to connect with others and see the outfits they've put together. Who knows, you might even get inspired! What happens to my outfit after I share it? Since the outfit isn't saved to your profile or avatar, sharing it is a way to immortalize your creation. We encourage using the daily hashtag when posting so others can admire your style! Can I participate in OOTD more than once per day? Currently, the OOTD feature is designed as a daily goal, meaning you can participate once per day. This ensures every user has a unique and engaging experience each time. How are the items for the OOTD feature chosen? The items are randomly selected to fit the day's theme, ensuring a wide variety of styles and possibilities. We also feature special hashtags and themes, like \"#ootd-goth-night\" or \"#ootd-pride\", to guide your creativity. Can I suggest themes or items for future OOTDs? While the feature currently operates on pre-selected themes and items, we love hearing from our community! Feel free to share your suggestions and ideas for future OOTD themes or items you'd love to see included. What's next for the OOTD feature? We're always looking to enhance your experience! Future updates may include integrating your own items into the OOTD closet, additional social sharing options, and even generating videos of your avatar getting styled.

Unlike usernames, display names do not need to be unique and can include spaces. This feature makes it easier for users to identify each other by their real or preferred names. Why Use Display Names? Usernames can often be difficult to remember and may not reflect how you identify your friends in real life. Display names allow for a more personal and familiar way to recognize and connect with friends within the app. How Do I Set My Display Name? During Registration: After customizing your avatar, you will be prompted to set your display name. Display names must be between 1 and 30 characters and cannot contain special characters or formatting. Profile Editing: You can update your display name anytime from your profile settings. If the field is empty, you will see a placeholder text: ‚ÄúAdd your name so friends can find you.‚Äù You cannot save a name that is over the character limit of 30 or contains inappropriate words. Where Will My Display Name Be Visible? Your display name will appear in various places within the app to help others identify you more easily: Profile and Mini-Profile Screens: Your display name will be the primary identifier, with your username shown in secondary secondarily on your profile and mini-profile screens. Inbox and Conversations: In active friends lists, conversation titles, and message previews, your display name will be shown. Search and Mentions: You can search or mention users using either their Display Name or Username. Frequently Asked Questions Can I use special characters in my Display Name? No, special characters are not allowed in display names. However, spaces are allowed. How often can I change my Display Name? There are currently no restrictions on how often you can change your display name. Will my username still be visible? Yes, your username will still be visible alongside your display name to ensure clarity and prevent impersonation. What happens if I deactivate my account? If your account is deactivated, your display name will not be visible, and your username will be replaced with ‚Äú[Deactivated].‚Äù What if someone has an offensive Display Name? If someone's Display Name is offensive, you can report them and our Trust & Safety team will review your report and take appropriate action.",

Child endangerment: We take the safety of all of our young players seriously. This is one of our most important guidelines and is a high priority for our trust and safety team. We have a zero-tolerance policy and do not allow any type of actions that could put our young players in danger or inappropriate situations. This includes but is not limited to the following: - Any sexualization of children - Child grooming or any type of predatory behavior - Misrepresenting yourself/age in order to speak to young players - Posting images, videos, or audio displaying children in sexual situations All confirmed reports of child endangerment will be reported to the authorities via The National Center for Missing & Exploited Children or other relevant legal channels. Sharing NSFW content: Highrise is a safe place to make friends and build experiences. It is not the place for any type of sexually graphic or gratifying content or behavior. Sharing text posts, photos, videos, audio, or participating in NSFW chats is not allowed, and will result in a permanent suspension if persistent inappropriate behavior is discovered. ‚Äã To protect our younger players, we make no exceptions on content containing nudity or sexual content, even if it‚Äôs intended to be artistic or for educational purposes. Lewd content: We do not allow sharing lewd content. This includes things such as, but are not limited to: - Photos/videos in lingerie - Photos/videos that are intended to be provocative or sexual - Photos/videos of sex toys - Room names or furniture organized in a sexually themed way - Anything else we deem inappropriate ‚Äã Please keep in mind that context matters, so if you post a photo in swimwear at a beach, that‚Äôs totally fine!

This includes, but is not limited to: - Offering nude photos or video - Offering sexual text or voice chats - Offering access to off-app sites or applications where players can view sexual content - Including info in your bio that leads to websites that display sexual/NSFW content - Sending links in public or private chats to websites that display sexual/NSFW content Illegal activities: Any illegal activities are prohibited on Highrise.

This includes, but is not limited to: - Posting content that includes or promotes the use of illegal narcotics - Posting content of yourself or others committing criminal acts - Posting content that violates the intellectual property or copyright law Targeted harassment, bullying, or hate speech: Do not engage in or post content encouraging the harassment or bullying of individuals or communities.

We don‚Äôt allow any hate speech, which includes but is not limited to: racist, homophobic, sexist, or hateful religious remarks. We will take action against any hateful conduct. We respect all communities and protected classes and do our best to ensure they have a safe experience on Highrise.

This includes but is not limited to: - Home address - Phone number - Email - Social Security number - Private photos/videos Please remember to always respect the privacy of other players. Multiple accounts: Ever feel like your own best friend? We won‚Äôt judge if you want to make a crew with 10 copies of yourself. Been there, done that. It‚Äôs totally okay to own more than one Highrise account. However, it‚Äôs not okay to use multiple accounts to hurt the community or gain an unfair advantage. We will take action if you are: - Using other accounts as a way to break the rules anonymously - Attempting to contact someone who has blocked you - Creating a large number of accounts to gain masses of rewards from events, offers, spins, etc. - Avoiding a temporary or permanent account suspension Circumvention: Circumventing tools that enable players to protect themselves and/or repeatedly targeting a player with unwanted friend requests or messages. Do not create spam accounts for the sake of annoying players with requests or other tactics. Do not disguise yourself in an attempt to contact someone who has blocked you. If a player has blocked you, you‚Äôll need to respect their decision. If you continue to contact a player that has blocked you this is considered harassment and your account may be suspended as a result. Glorifying or promoting self-harm or suicide: This includes any content that encourages others to cut or injure themselves; embrace anorexia, bulimia, or other eating disorders; or commit suicide rather than for example, seeking counseling or treatment. Online communities have the power to lift people up from dark places - be the kind of person who lifts others. If you notice that someone is in need of urgent help, please contact your local authorities. Self-destructive behavior: Posting any content where you are endangering yourself is prohibited on Highrise. This includes, but is not limited to: - Self-harm - Threats of suicide - Dangerous activity that could result in physical harm - Dangerous use of illegal drugs - Consuming a dangerous amount of alcohol Even if these posts are made for entertainment purposes or as jokes we will take action when we feel this behavior could lead to you being harmed.

Seek support from your friends, family, teachers, or anyone else you trust, and let them know how you‚Äôre feeling. If you have trouble bringing up this topic to those close to you, you could start out by saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going through a hard time right now and I was hoping I could share what‚Äôs been on my mind with you. Do you have time to listen?‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm feeling ______, and I would like to talk to someone about it. If this is okay with you, can we sit down together and chat?‚Äù and expand further from there. Seek help from a local self-care expert: https://findtreatment.samhsa.gov/ If it‚Äôs an emergency, please contact 911 or your local hospital for immediate help. Gore: Sharing any content containing gore and/or animal cruelty. Do not share or post content for sadistic pleasure, glorification, or celebration of violence. We do allow exceptions for hobbies that may be misclassified under this guideline, such as hunting. If you are simply sharing a trophy photo, for example, this would be okay. Scamming: One of the best parts of Highrise is being able to trade all the fun, unique items our community has to offer. Be careful, though! Some players might try to steal your gold or items through social manipulation or trading antics. When trading, we always recommend using our storefront trade system or Market. Make sure to review the trade window before confirming your trade. Anyone attempting to scam through our trading system will be actioned. This means: - Removing offered items in the trade window at the last second - Sending fake tip messages in the chat window - Asking for your account information for any reason - Offering payment or other exchanged goods outside of Highrise When these scams are reported to us, we will do our best to investigate and take appropriate action. Sometimes, you may be invited to participate in - shall we call them - alternate trading methods. We can‚Äôt enforce these types of trades, so engage them at your own risk: - Borrowing gold or items with the promise of returning them later - Giving someone gold or items first and allowing them to pay for it later - Reserving items with a deposit payment - Promising to pay via tips after an item is traded - Designing rooms or creating artwork in exchange for gold or items - Player-made events or giveaways with entry fees or prizes All trades are final, so please be extra cautious when trading! Highrise will not be able to return stolen gold or items. Crew Event Minimums Creating a crew is a big responsibility! You can set your own rules for who you accept into your crew and how each member is expected to behave. This means that if you set ticket minimums for eventing, you are in charge of vetting and selecting crew members you believe are capable of helping your team achieve its goals. We aren‚Äôt able to enforce crew-specific ticket minimums, or if someone decides not to participate in an event after joining. If you do set ticket minimums or other rules for your crew, make sure everyone is informed and on the same page! Bug abuse: Do not exploit any bugs or errors that you discover on Highrise for your personal gain. If you discover an exploit, report it to our concierge team immediately, and you will be rewarded with a bug bounty. If you fail to report an exploit and instead decide to abuse it, your account will be suspended and potentially permanently removed. Offline trading: We do not allow the trading of accounts, items, or gold in exchange for money outside of the Highrise trading system. This is unsafe, as there is no guarantee of either party honoring the transaction. Buying accounts, items, or gold for money outside of the Highrise trading system will result in the removal of those items and possibly a temporary/permanent suspension. Accounts cannot be traded, sold, or given away. All accounts must be used by their original creator. If you advertise that you are buying, selling, or giving away an account, you may be temporarily suspended or even permanently banned. If you violate this guideline and it results in you being scammed, our concierge team will not be able to help. Phishing: Attempting to steal another player‚Äôs account will result in a permanent ban. This includes sending password requests to support for accounts that don‚Äôt belong to you, brute force hacking another player‚Äôs account or any other method of account theft. Spamming: Spamming is not permitted on Highrise. Spamming is defined as the following actions performed on a mass scale which includes, but is not limited to: - Making multiple comments of the same message with the intent to disrupt players - Tagging players multiple times with the intent to disrupt them - Sending multiple messages messaging both in-room or a players inbox with the intent to disrupt them - Using macros, scripts, or any other methods to spam in a room chat Impersonation: Do not create impostor accounts pretending to be a Highrise staff member, a celebrity, or another player. Be who you wanna be, but don‚Äôt attempt to use someone else‚Äôs authority or reputation to influence the community. Witch hunting: Witch-hunting sounds like a great pastime if you live in 17th-century New England. However, we don‚Äôt allow any form of witch-hunting on Highrise. ‚Äã This action is classified as any type of public accusation, call to action, or other targeted harassment against another player, including but not limited to: public posts about another player, screenshots of your conversations, in-room campaigns, and the creation of hashtags designed to rally the community against a specific player. ‚Äã If someone is breaking our guidelines, your best course of action is to block and report them using our in-app reporting system. Witch-hunting is never okay, frequently involves false accusations, and creates a toxic environment of hate for all players involved. You have the power to help keep our community safe and welcoming, and taking part in witch-hunting behavior is the antithesis of what we‚Äôre working to build together. Ban evasion: We do not allow players to create new accounts to circumvent a suspension. All suspensions will last until their expiration or a successful appeal. If you‚Äôve been suspended permanently, then we have decided to no longer allow you to use our application in any capacity unless otherwise stated. If you decide to create a new account to circumvent a suspension, then it is subject to being suspended as well. Fraudulent refund requests: Submitting false or dishonest refund requests to Apple, Google, or Highrise directly may result in your account being permanently suspended. Abusing the report system: Our reporting tool helps us keep the community safe, but don‚Äôt misuse it! Sending false reports, faking evidence, or sending multiple reports about the same issue is prohibited. Submitting false support requests: If you‚Äôre experiencing a particular issue, like missing gold from an in-app purchase or a technical glitch, feel free to contact us from FAQ & Support, and we‚Äôd be more than happy to assist you. However, please note that submitting false requests to our support team may result in a permanent suspension of your account. Some false requests include but are not limited to: - Sending requests containing false information or information cherry-picked with the intent to manipulate our concierge staff. - Requesting access to accounts that do not belong to you. - Submitting false claims about missing gold or items. - Repeatedly requesting more information or a different outcome for an issue where our position has already been made clear. Consequences and actions: - Breaking our guidelines can result in a warning, mute, temporary suspension, or permanent ban. The actions we take are decided on a case-by-case basis and at our discretion. - We reserve the right to take action for any reason we deem against our community principles, even if they are not specifically covered in these guidelines. - Depending on the type of guideline broken, if you are permanently suspended, you are no longer allowed to play Highrise on any accounts. - If you have more than one account, we reserve the right to take action against any and all of your accounts. This means creating an alternate account to violate our guidelines will result in your main account also having action taken against it. - You are responsible for your account. This means any violation that occurs on your account, even by another person, will result in that account having action taken against it.",

        "content": "How does the Highrise chat filter work? Our shiny new system is designed to keep the chat in Highrise as friendly and respectful as the neighborhood dog (minus the slobber). It keeps a keen eye out for nasties like harassment, explicit content, and hate speech, while still letting you chat about life, the universe, and why pineapple on pizza is controversial. ‚Äã So what's allowed and what's not? If it's in our Community Guidelines' naughty list, it'll tickle our filter's radar. Casual swearing? Sure, we're 13+, after all. But targeted abuse, explicit stuff, or a vocabulary that would make a sailor blush? That'll be a no-go. Here's the fun part: our filter is smarter than your average bear. It looks at words in context, not just individually. So, whether you're talking about soccer balls or... well, other balls, it knows the difference. ‚Äã Each player gets a reputation based on their chat history. Think of it like a social credit score. If you're the model citizen of chat land, you'll enjoy more chat privileges. But if you're a serial disturber of the peace, some of those privileges might be put on pause. Slip up and get a bad rep? No worries! You can get back in our good books by behaving nicely. Reputation is fluid - it doesn't change instantly, and you won't be branded a villain for one angry message. Just keep the chat clean and friendly for a bit, and you'll be back in the green. ‚Äã We're still tweaking and tuning the system, so we appreciate your patience during this \"getting it just right\" phase. Got feedback, or questions, or just want to say hi? Drop us a line at [email¬†protected] . We're all ears!",

Fear not, we've got a map to guide you: See, we at Highrise are great at many things, but handling gold from sponsors isn't our forte.

Here's the secret path: Tap 'shop' (it's hiding in the bottom right-hand corner). At the shop, choose 'cash store'. Now, scroll down to the very bottom where the offerwall partner offers are hanging out. Instead of a price, you'll see a welcoming 'Go'. Hit 'Go' for the provider you used (like hitting the bullseye!). If your provider was IronSource, click 'in-progress'. If it's Tapjoy, hit the three lines in the top left corner and choose 'Reward Status'. Tap on the offer that's still holding your gold hostage. On the bottom left of this page, there's a 'missing gold' button. Give it a tap. In the bottom left of the next page, you'll find a 'contact support' option. Tap this to send a support ticket to our offer partner. They'll play detective and help you unearth your missing gold.

        "content": "Ever wondered why Gold Bars carry a heftier price tag than Gold in Highrise? Well, it's time to spill the secrets: Gold Bars come with a 10% premium, like adding truffle oil to your french fries. So, if you're buying a 500G Gold Bar, it'll cost you 550 Gold from your vault. Why the price hike, you ask? Well... Gold Bars are the social butterflies of our virtual world; they love to be traded! Meanwhile, Gold prefers to stay put, a tad shy about being traded. The extra cost of Gold Bars is like a superhero fighting inflation in Highrise. How? Well, every time a Gold Bar changes hands, it shape-shifts back into Gold, and poof!

        "url": "https://support.highrise.game/en/articles/9331814-what-is-earned-gold",
        "category": "Gold, Bubbles and Payments",
        "content": "What is Earned Gold? Earned Gold is a flexible currency awarded to community creators. Item designers, room and World builders, bot creators, and hosts typically receive Earned Gold as compensation for enriching Highrise with their art, worlds and experiences. How is it used? Earned Gold can be used just like regular Gold: with it, you can spin grabs, trade, tip, and use it to buy items, Voice Tokens, Room Boost, and more. However, unlike regular gold, Earned Gold can also be cashed out for real money . The current exchange rate is 750 Gold = $1 USD. Using Earned Gold in Highrise The only way to view how much Earned Gold you have is through the Creator Exchange on our Create Portal. Right now, you cannot view your Earned Gold balance in either the mobile Highrise app, or on our website. When you visit the Creator Exchange, you may view your total Earned Gold below the description for Cashout requirements. This number does not include your regular Gold. Please note that, again, your total Earned Gold balance is only visible on the Creator Exchange! There is no way to view how much you have in either the mobile Highrise app or on our website highrise.game . Earned Gold displays as regular Gold in all other Highrise applications. Spending Earned Gold Whenever you use gold, payments will preferentially draw from your regular Highrise Gold before tapping into your Earned Gold. If you think of your gold wallet as a big bucket, imagine Earned Gold living at the bottom of the bucket: any purchase you make will scrape away gold from the top of the bucket before reaching your Earned Gold. However, should you run out of regular gold, you will begin to draw on your Earned Gold funds! There is no alert to notify you when you are using Earned Gold. Please keep an eye on your Earned Gold in the Creator Exchange if you would prefer to save it up for a Cashout. Tipping with Earned Gold Earned Gold spent in Highrise will always function like regular gold. Anyone you Tip using Earned Gold will receive regular Gold. Setting Up Your Cashout Account Visit the Creator Exchange to set up an account and onboard with our payment processing partner, Tipalti. Here are the overall requirements to Cashout your Earned Gold. Before you can submit a Cashout Request for your Earned Gold, you‚Äôll need to meet the following criteria: Only one cash out request per calendar month: when planning your withdrawals, please bear in mind that processing your request may take up to 30 days. As such, we only support one cashout per user per month. Be at least 13 years of age. Have at least 35,000 Earned Gold in your account: the Earned Gold you currently own is displayed on the Cashout screen. You may cash out less than 35,000 EG. However, you must exceed this minimum threshold before you can submit a withdrawal request. Be in compliance with service requirements: use only your real information when creating an account through Tipalti. Fraudulent activity will result in a ban, with no additional recourse for withdrawing your pending funds. Be in complete compliance with Highrise TOS and Community Guidelines: suspended and banned accounts are not eligible to cash out. Additionally, HR may deny a cash out request at the discretion of our Trust & Safety team. Have a W-9 (for US taxpayers) or W-8 (for non-US taxpayers): when onboarding with Tipalti, you‚Äôll need to have your identification ready. Have a payable Tipalti account on file: tap the link to onboard with Tipalti. We‚Äôll go over the onboarding steps in more detail below. Onboarding with Tipalti Before you start, have this information ready: Your contact information, including your address. Your payment information . Here are the payment options: Direct Deposit / ACH or Wire Transfer: you‚Äôll need your bank routing number and account number Check: share your address to receive a physical check PayPal: input the email address used for your PayPal account Tax forms For most US taxpayer individuals, you may use your Social Security Number (SSN) as your TIN (Tax ID Number). For businesses, you may enter your EIN (Employer ID Number). For non-US individual and business entities, you may complete and upload the W-8 8233 form provided by Tipalti. Submitting a Cashout Request Once you‚Äôve accrued at least 35,000 Earned Gold, you may request a Cashout. Cashouts require a minimum of 35,000 EG, but you may withdraw any amount below this threshold (ie, you own 40,000 and can cash out 30,000) The current exchange rate is 750 Earned Gold = $1 USD. You may only request a Cashout once per calendar month After you submit your request, HR Staff will review your submission to ensure you meet our requirements (accurate payment information, good community standing, etc.) Check the status of your Cashout request and review previous Cashouts by visiting Payment History on the Creator Exchange. Processing your Cashout may take up to 30 day s from the time you submit your Cashout request. Please be patient, but feel free to check in with our team if you notice any issues or unusual delays in your Cashout. FAQ How will I know if I‚Äôve been awarded Earned Gold or Regular Gold? Most Earned Gold will be sent to you via your Inbox Gifts tab. Earned Gold will labeled as such in your Gifts tab whenever you win a Concept, host an experience, achieve high Worlds engagement, or win a Highrise-sponsored competition. In this example, we can see the difference between a regular 5G Gold Gift and a 5G Earned Gold Gift. While your Earned Gold is distinguishable from regular Gold when you receive it, once you hit ‚ÄúCLAIM‚Äù it will enter your wallet and integrate with your other Gold funds. From that point forward, the only way to check your Earned Gold balance is on the Creator Exchange. Can I cancel my cashout request? No; once you‚Äôve submitted a Cashout request, there is no way to undo or edit your request. If you‚Äôve made an error, please contact our Support team so we can clear your request and refund your Earned Gold. How can I change my payment information? After onboarding with Tipalti, you can update your information any time by visiting the Creator Exchange, and tapping on the link in the Cashout Requirements page that says ‚Äúpayable Tipalti account‚Äù. I already have a Tipalti account from the Pocket Coin era. Can I use it? No; you‚Äôll have to onboard again. Old accounts are not transferrable, so please onboard with Tipalti again to get set up for Cashout. I can‚Äôt onboard with Tipalti. Can I still Cashout? No: you need a payable account with Tipalti to receive your funds. If you are unable to finish the onboarding process for any reason (no payment method, no tax ID) you may still use Earned Gold just like regular Gold in Highrise. Please contact Support for any other issues! I accidentally spent Earned Gold instead of regular Gold! Can I have a refund? Unfortunately, we can‚Äôt refund accidental purchases! Please be sure to check in on your total Earned Gold reservoir by visiting the Creator Exchange. I don‚Äôt want Earned Gold. Can I have regular Gold for my prize instead? Lucky you - Earned Gold can be used just like regular Gold in Highrise. If you don‚Äôt want to bother with Tipalti, cashing out, or keeping track of how much Earned Gold you have, you can simply spend it as you normally would within the world of Highrise.",

Don't worry, if an hour isn't enough, you can always extend the fun. A couple of pop-ups will pop up when you start. One is just checking if we can use your microphone (you know, for the voice part of Voice Chat). If you accidentally hit \"deny\", you'll need to pop into your device's settings to allow access. Once you've got the Voice Chat up and running, you can mute your mic with a tap if you need a moment of silence. As the room owner or moderator, you also get the power to invite anyone in the room to join the voice chat. Don't worry, they'll get a friendly pop-up invite to join the chat. Keep an eye on the Visitors Bar - it'll show you who's got Voice Chat privileges. If you see a crossed-out mic, it means that player is currently keeping quiet. ‚Äã You'll see the following options on the Voice Chat menu: Deafen Voice: For when you need a little peace and quiet.

The partner we're working with to provide Voice Chat charges us a pretty penny. The gold fee helps us cover some of those costs.

It's like a reality show, but way more interesting! ‚Äã Turning on Spectating is as simple as flicking a light switch. Just stroll over to your Room Settings. Remember, only the Room Owner has the power to turn on or off the Spectating spotlight. Let's show the world how it's done! So, you're curious about this Spectating mode, huh? Think of it as your personal TV channel - when your room is bursting at the seams, any newcomers transform into spectators, silently watching the magic unfold. ‚Äã Finding out who's watching is easy peasy! Just pop into the \"People in Room\" tab, and you'll see a list of spectators and active visitors. Wondering what spectators can do? Well, they can: Enjoy the show, watching avatars and text chats in action Tune into a live Voice Chat, just like a podcast Send Tips to any player strutting their stuff in the room Shoot off emoji reactions (hearts, winks) to show appreciation But, there are a few no-nos for spectators. They can't: Stroll around or be seen in the room (it's a no-ghost zone!) Join in the text chat or Voice Chat If a spot opens up, all the spectators will get an invite to join the room. It's a race - the quickest to hit \"Join\" gets in. But hey, no pressure! If you prefer being a silent observer, keep on spectating till the cows come home! ‚Äã So you're a wallflower at heart, and you just want to watch? I got you! As long as the room owner has enabled the Spectating feature and the room is filled to the brim, you can slip into spectator mode - no mingling necessary! ‚Äã Worried about a crowd? Don't be! Your room is a theater, and there's no limit on ticket sales. Pack in as many spectators as you like, the more, the merrier! ‚Äã Now, let's chat about the law of the land. In the wild world of spectating, rules are the same for everyone. Just like any other visitor, Spectators can be kicked, banned, and reported by room moderators. And yes, you can report someone who's misbehaving, too. It's our collective responsibility to keep this a fun and safe space for all, right? So, let's watch out for each other!",

SkyPass is absolutely free and open to everyone! ‚Äã Ready to embark on your daily adventure? Simply log in and tap the delightful blue icon at the upper left corner of your screen. Voila! You're now on the SkyPass tracks. Here, you'll find a range of tasks, from visiting a trading room to building a sculpture. Complete a goal, and guess what? You'll earn shiny Stars! ‚Äã Now, let's talk about Stars and Tiers. Stars are like tokens designed exclusively for SkyPass, and they're your ticket to leveling up through different tiers. Each day, you'll be challenged with an Easy, Medium, and Hard task. The tougher the task, the greater the reward! As you progress, unlocking each Tier will bring you a variety of awesome rewards. From bubbles and stylish clothing items to Free Spin Tokens and more, there's something for everyone. Be warned though, advancing through Tiers may require hundreds to thousands of Stars. Fear not! You can always purchase Stars with gold to speed up your progress. ‚Äã Ah, the seasons of SkyPass! They're like magical reward-filled journeys that last around a month or so. Picture this: unique sets of rewards await you during each season. Exciting, right? ‚Äã Now, let's talk about SkyPass+. It's the VIP upgrade that unlocks an additional rewards track. For only $9.99 per season, you'll get all the regular SkyPass rewards plus extras like bonus gold and snazzy, tradable clothing items. Currently, SkyPass+ is only available as an in-app purchase. Remember, it's a one-time purchase per season, so if you want to keep those amazing SkyPass+ benefits in a new season, you'll need to make another purchase of $9.99. ‚Äã Imagine this scenario: You decide to get SkyPass+ in the middle of a season. Bam! You instantly unlock the premium rewards for all the reward tiers you've already reached. And that's not all‚Äîevery new tier you conquer from that point onward also grants you both the free and premium rewards. It's like a reward bonanza! ‚Äã Oops, forgot to claim your rewards before the SkyPass season ended? No worries, we've got you covered! All those fantastic unclaimed rewards will be automatically sent your way at the end of the season. Can't find them in your inventory? Just check Inbox > Gifts, and there they are! ‚Äã Now, what if you don't see SkyPass at all? Let's troubleshoot! Make sure your device is running iOS 3.16.0 / Android 1.22.0 or a later version. If you're a rookie Highriser, complete your account setup by acing all three challenges of the tutorial with Pedra. If SkyPass isn't active, don't fret! When a season ends, the blue SkyPass icon will turn green, and you'll start receiving bubbles instead of Stars. But don't worry, a new SkyPass season will be on its way soon. Stay tuned! ‚Äã Got more questions we didn't cover? Spotted a major issue or have a brilliant suggestion? We want to hear from you! Visit highrise.canny.io to share your feedback directly with the devs. Since this is a brand-new feature, your input means the world to us! Get ready to embark on an exciting journey with SkyPass.

This will bring up the Spin Rates for that grab and any Swap Rates (if that grab has swapping enabled) Are the Spin Rates the same for all Grabs? No, Spin Rates are not the same for all Grabs and change very often. We recommend checking the Spin Rates before you begin spinning any grab. If an item in a Grab has a 10% Spin Rate, and I've spun it 100 times, how have I not won the item? Is the Grab rigged? While it might be some bad luck, it's most definitely not rigged. The common misconception here is not realizing each spin is an independent variable. Imagine our game's spins like reaching into a bag of 100 marbles, where 10 are red (winning marbles) and 90 are blue. Each spin is like pulling out a marble, checking its color, and then putting it back. No matter how many times you reach in, your chance of pulling out a red marble is always 10%. Just like pulling marbles from the bag, each game spin is an independent event. This means that spinning 100 times doesn't guarantee you'll pull out 10 red marbles. It's completely possible to have a streak of blue ones because every spin is a fresh chance, not affected by the previous or future spins.",

The probability percentage is always displayed on Second-hand Grabs. So, if you're feeling lucky, give it a whirl! What Happens When a Rarity Runs Out? Here's the scoop: when all items of a specific rarity are drawn, that rarity's odds get added to the lowest remaining one. So, if your Rare items run out, their odds get passed on to the Common ones. Can I Monitor My Grab Activity? Absolutely! You can see who drew from your grab, what they got, and how much gold they spent, all through the handy history button on the Second-hand Grab interface. What Can Visitors Do? Visitors can view your username, check out the odds, draw from the grab, and keep track of updates and wins.

        "content": "What are Progress Rewards? Think of Progress Rewards as delightful bonuses you get for spinning grabs and collecting new items - a little treat on your journey to that coveted Legendary! ‚Äã How to Unlock Progress Rewards? Spin and win! Unlock Progress Rewards by spinning and nabbing unique items from a grab. All Rare and Epic items help fill your Progress Meter, but duplicates don't count. The Progress Rewards usually pop up halfway or 3/4 of the way towards the total items needed to snag the grab's Legendary. Take a grab with 16 items, for example. You'd get the Progress Reward after spinning and winning 10 unique items out of 16. This reward doesn't count towards unlocking the Legendary ‚Äì it's just a pat on the back for getting closer to your goal! Spotting Grabs with Progress Rewards? Grabs with Progress Rewards have an extra Progress Reward Meter under the standard Completion Reward Meter. It shows your current tally of unique items and how many more you need for the Progress Reward. Claiming the Progress Reward? Easy peasy! Once your Progress Meter is full, the Progress Reward is auto-claimed. Spin that final item, and a fancy animation will pop up with your reward. Tap on the grab ball and boom! Your reward is in your closet inventory. Extra Queries? Are all Progress Rewards account-bound? Initially, yes. Our first couple of grabs with Progress Rewards use account-bound items. But we're all for shaking things up. Keep an eye out ‚Äì who knows what might pop up next! Do all Progress Rewards require the same number of items to unlock? Not at all! Different grabs need varying numbers of items to complete. So, the count of items needed to unlock Progress Rewards can differ too. Can I get the Progress Reward again once I complete the whole grab? Absolutely! After claiming the Legendary and finishing the grab, all progress resets. Your Progress and Completion Meters hit zero, and you can spin the grab from scratch, unlocking all its rewards as many times as you wish. Let the fun begin...again!",

Once you've opened the Black Market menu, tap on the ‚ûï in the upper right to list your items. Select the item you'd like to list and set a price. Each type of rarity will require a different minimum price: Common, Uncommon, Rare : 150G Epic: 500G Legendary: 2,000G On the \"List an Item\" screen, you'll see a few key bits of info: the current number of listings; the floor price (the minimum price at which you can list) and average price (determined by the typical rates at which that item has been selling). This info is here to give you a better idea of how much your particular item is worth, along with how popular or rare it might be. You can check out your listings and toggle through the filters for Active or Sold listings at any time by tapping on the My Listings tab at the top of the main Market Menu. After you make a sale, return to the My Listings tab and toggle the Sold filter to collect your Gold. How do I buy items? When you open the Market, you'll see a page full of newly listed goods. Tap on an item that catches your fancy to open a menu presenting users who currently have that item for sale, and then peruse the listings to find the best deals! Each item will display number of listings, floor price, and average price Scroll through various users to see who's selling for the best price! Frequently Asked Questions What items are eligible to be listed on the Market? The item you list must be: Tradeable A clothing item Not currently available in a secondhand grab or active trade I listed an item in the Market, and now I can't find it in my inventory. Help! Don't panic! This is essentially the same behavior as when you place an item inside a trade or Secondhand Grab machine. The item will be returned to you if you cancel the listing. I listed an item in the Market at the wrong price. How do I edit the listing? It is currently not possible to edit an active listing. Instead, you can remove the listing to return the item to your inventory and then list it again at the correct price. Note: If you list an item for an incorrect price and it sells before you can cancel and correct it, there is no way to reverse the trade. So please be cautious when listing your items. Why is there a fee on Market purchases? This is done to reduce Gold inflation in the Highrise economy. We want your Gold and items to maintain value over time, and the simplest way to do this is to place a small fee on player-to-player transactions. Why do my listings expire? ‚Äã To efficiently manage the high volume of Market listings, we've introduced a 30-day expiration policy. After this period, expired listings will be removed from the Market and restored to your account.",

        "url": "https://support.highrise.game/en/articles/8380145-what-should-i-do-if-my-items-are-buggy",
        "category": "Bugs and Troubleshooting",
        "content": "How to make a report Sometimes you may encounter a buggy item - maybe a strand of hair won't change color, or your avatar's clothing clips or layers incorrectly. If you notice an item is buggy or glitched, first delete and reinstall your app to make sure you have the most up-to-date version. To report an item bug or suggest an edit to an item, tap \"Contact Us\" at the top right of this page. You will be connected with our Concierge Desk: please tell the concierge you want to report a buggy item. Our concierge team will ask you a few more questions to help filter your requests. Once you are ready to make your report, please be as descriptive as possible about the issue you are experiencing. List the names of any items affected, and include photos or videos. This really helps us to understand the issue. We will have the team assess the issue and determine if it's something we can fix. Please read the info below about how we determine if we can and should edit items. Objective bug vs. Subjective feedback When we get a request to edit an item, we try to determine whether it is an objective bug vs subjective feedback. An objective bug is when an item is significantly broken, flawed or improperly set up. As the item is not functioning as intended, leaving an item in the game in this state lowers the quality of our game. Examples include: Color changing parts not working (skin, hair, eye color) Part of the item or avatar is missing Subjective feedback is a request based on the user's personal preference. The item isn't technically broken or buggy. The item is functioning as intended, but some users might prefer it to be different. Examples include: This item should be blue, not red The position of this item is a little weird When fixing bugs or editing items, we are always trying to improve the quality of our game. We definitely want to fix objective bugs, but subjective feedback is trickier. Sometimes editing an item that has already been released can have unintended effects: it could change the value of the item, affecting the in-game economy. Or, it could confuse and upset players who liked the item the way it was originally. We often have to assess each request on a case by case basis. Art Feedback Canny https://highrise.canny.io/art-item-suggestions If you have a suggestion for an item edit, we encourage you to post it in our Canny under Art and Item Suggestions. We use the Canny to collect feedback from players, to learn how to improve the items we make in the future. In Canny, players can upvote suggestions they like, so it's easy to see what's popular amongst the community. If a post is getting a lot of attention in Canny, we will be sure to keep that suggestion in mind. How we assess whether to change an old item When we get a report of an item bug or a request to change an item, there are a lot of factors to consider when determining how to proceed. Is it objectively buggy, flawed, broken or improperly set up? Does it lower the quality of our game? Can we fix/change this? Sometimes there are objective bugs we don't have the ability to fix with our current system. Will changing it affect the value of the item(s)? Are there other users who would prefer the item not be changed? Is this a user designed item? Is the user who designed this item requesting the change? Did that user have proper opportunity to review the item during the production process or are the requesting a change outside of the allotted feedback opportunity? Each request will have different considerations, and sometimes we try different things. Overall, we are working to create a standardized policy that makes the community happy and helps create a quality game. Bugs we can't fix Unfortunately, there are some bugs or glitches with our items that we can't fix with our current system. In these cases, even though we all agree the item is buggy or flawed, we simply have to let it go. Here's some examples of common bugs/glitches that we know about but can't fix: Gloves are layering on top of the shirt sleeves Pupils are animating outside the bounds of the eye You can still report these issues and we will collect your reports to better understand and prioritize how our system can be improved.",

Safety Lock is a feature that gives you an additional layer of security beyond your username and password. Safety lock allows you to set a 6-digit PIN on your account that prevents anyone who logs into your account on a different device from accessing specific features until they input your 6-digit PIN correctly. The features that are blocked off until your PIN is entered are: Trading Changing your email address Changing your password Connecting accounts (such as Google, Snapchat, etc.) Adding items to a Secondhand Grab machine Changing your username Where can I access Safety Lock? You can access the safety lock and set up your 6-digit PIN via your account‚Äôs settings page. Simply tap on the safety lock and enable it, and you‚Äôll then be prompted to select a 6-digit PIN. Please see the images below if you‚Äôre having trouble: Do I have to enable Safety Lock? Nope! It‚Äôs an optional feature, but more security never hurts, right? Do I need to register an email address to enable Safety Lock? Yup! A registered email address is required. Please make sure you use a secure email that you have access to, as you‚Äôll be resetting your PIN via this email if you ever forget it. What should I do if I forget my 6-digit PIN? Ah, forgetful, are we? That‚Äôs fine, we planned for this. In your settings, on the Safety Lock page, just simply choose the ‚Äòforgot pin‚Äô option. Once that option is selected we'll go ahead and send you a pin reset link to your registered email address. Can support just send me a new pin or give me a hint about my pin? Nope, your 6-digit PIN is encrypted. Our support team can‚Äôt see, hear, touch, or smell it. Bummer! What happens if I don't activate Safety Lock and my account is compromised?

        "category": "Account Settings and Security",
        "content": "At Highrise, our number one goal is for players to connect from around the world and come together to have fun in a safe and welcoming environment. To ensure the safety of our players, we have a host of tools players can use (and some working in the background) to keep them safe from bad actors. This guide will go through those tools and offer some general tips so that you can keep yourself as safe as possible while playing. Minimum age requirements: The suggested age to play Highrise is 17+, with the minimum being 13 . We‚Äôve chosen this recommended age because many of our players tend to be on the older side and may discuss topics or use language not suitable for young children. Please note that regardless of your age, sexual content is not allowed on Highrise. If we have reasons to believe a player might be younger than 13 years of age, and they are not able to provide proof of their age, they will be removed from the app. Sharing personal information: When chatting with other players, it‚Äôs impossible to know who they really are or their true intentions, so please do not share your personal information with anyone for any reason. Things you should never share are your home address, phone number, real name, links to your social media, etc. Sharing your account details: Never share your account details with any other players for any reason. Even if they promise things like ‚Äòfree gold‚Äô in return, these are tactics players will use to get onto your account and steal your items. If a player sends you a link to any off-app website or form asking you to input your Highrise details, please do not follow the link as it may be malicious. Instead, report & block that player. These links are a common tactic known as phishing, and that player is attempting to gain access to your account to steal your items, or worse, install malicious software on your device. For reference, Highrise staff will NEVER ask for your password or safety lock pin. Keeping your account safe: Here are some tips on keeping your account information safe: 1. Set an email address for your account that has not been involved in any database leaks . You can check if your account has even been breached here: https://haveibeenpwned.com/ 2. Set up 2-factor authentication (2FA) if available on this email. This ensures no one can gain access to this email address and reset your password. For example, here is Gmail‚Äôs guide for enabling 2FA: https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185839? 3. Use a secure password - Do not set a password that is easy to guess or that you've used on other applications. Set something unique with at least 8 characters. Make sure to include punctuation and random characters (@,!,&); doing this makes it nearly impossible for a player to guess your password.  You can even use an application that can generate and store extremely secure passwords for you, and the best part is it's free - https://www.lastpass.com/ 4. Enable our Safety Lock feature to prevent players who access your account from removing any items without knowing your pin. Blocking & Reporting players: If, for any reason, you no longer want a player to be able to contact you or interact with you in any way, you can block them using our block feature. Blocking a player will prevent them from messaging you, visiting your feed, tagging you in posts, and visiting your room.  You can block a player by visiting their profile, clicking the ellipses (three dots) in the top right corner, and then clicking the ‚ÄòBlock player‚Äô option. If any player is violating our guidelines, you can report them to us, and our team will review your report and take appropriate action against that player. You can report a player by visiting their profile, clicking the ellipses (three dots) in the top right corner, clicking the ‚Äòreport‚Äô option, and then choosing the report reason. To report a player in a room without visiting their profile, you can click their avatar icon in the chatbox, then the flag in the top right corner of their mini profile view. Uploading video and images: The general rule is once something has been uploaded to the internet, it is there forever. Please keep this in mind when deciding what to upload to your feed. Players can repost your photos and videos, take screenshots, download them, etc. So make sure you‚Äôre okay with this before hitting the post button. Our Safety Tools: üë∂ Age Restrictions: Players are asked for their date of birth when they sign up. You must be 13 or older to play Highrise. Accounts from players younger than 18 years old have certain restrictions and are subject to more strict moderation to ensure their safety. When we identify a player that could be underage, or they are reported to us by other players, we investigate and have the option to remove them. üö® Community Guidelines: We have rules in place to keep Highrise safe. Everyone receives a link to our Community Guidelines when they join Highrise. If they break any of these rules, we take action. We want to engage and educate players, so the first step is often a warning message about their behavior. If they continue misbehaving, we may permanently suspend their account. ü§ñ Technical Tools & Moderation : We use human moderators and an AI-powered moderation platform to detect content that may break our Community Guidelines. This includes: Detecting underage players. Filtering out inappropriate chat messages. Filtering out inappropriate posts and photos. Flagging bad actors for investigation. We‚Äôre working hard to improve our technical tools and moderation techniques all the time. üö´ Blocking & Reporting: We have a simple and effective report feature in the app (just tap on the flag icon!). We encourage our players to report suspicious activity and inappropriate behavior to us. This includes: Sexually explicit and violent content. Bullying and harassment. Minor safety concerns. Illegal activities. Fraud and scams. Fake profiles. We prioritize reports of urgent threats and emergencies and pass the details to the relevant authorities when necessary. We also provide helpline contact details to our players.

        "content": "How do I change my username? Players can change their username by visiting their account's settings page and selecting the \"Username\" option under account management. Please see the image below if you are having trouble locating this option. What happens when I change my username? When a player changes their username, this changes their username everywhere on the application. The username that you use to log in is also changed to your newly set username. Does it cost gold to change my username? All players receive one name change for free but all name changes after that will cost 10,000 gold. Can I revert back to my old username? After any name change, players receive a 14-day period where they can revert to their original username for free. During that 14-day window, their original username is reserved which will prevent other players from taking it. However, if these 14-days lapse then players will have to pay 10,000 coins if they wish to change their username back. Please note though that the username may be taken by other players once the 14 day period passes so it may no longer be available. Can I change my username to anything I want? Players can only change their username to a username that is available. So if the username you are seeking is already taken by another user you will not be able to choose it. On top of this, the standard username rules apply. If a user is inactive can I have their username? Players cannot take over inactive usernames, sorry. If a player has a username set then that username cannot be used by anyone else even if that player has not been active for a while.",

        "content": "What‚Äôs the UDC feature? User Design Contest (UDC) is a feature that allows players to submit their own item designs for various art competitions here at Highrise. Winning designs will be turned into real items by the art team. What kinds of contests will this be used for? All the contests! Here‚Äôs a quick refresher on the different types of art and design contests we run. Grab Design Contests: players make a full grab of 12-15 unique items. Graabs are released in major events, and winners will receive the full grab (with their name credited!) alongside a gold prize. Mini Design Contests: players design items or accessories for a grab or shop collection, and also receive name credit, gold, and the items themselves. Art Design Contests: make a card, item, or decoration and have your work added directly to the game! Remember! All contests have a cooldown period which will preclude a winner‚Äôs eligibility for that contest type for one contest cycle. For example, if you win a Grab Contest, you won‚Äôt be able to enter the next Grab Contest, but you can still enter a Mini Design or Art Design Contest. Where do I find this feature? The UDC system is accessible on web (joinhighrise.com) while a contest is running. Each time a contest starts, Highrise EN will make an announcement post with the contest dates and a link to the submission tool. How does the new tool work? Inside the web menu, you‚Äôll see a set of contest stages running from: ‚úèÔ∏è SUBMISSION üñ§ VOTING üïí WAITING FOR RESULTS ‚≠ê FINAL VOTE üëë WINNERS ANNOUNCED SUBMISSION Stage: This is the only period at which you can - you know - submit your entry. The Browse tab will be empty at this stage, so you won‚Äôt be able to view other user‚Äôs entries or cast any votes. Tab over to My Submissions to see your entries, and long press on a submission to pull up the Action Menu. VOTING Stage: During this phase, you can start browsing through all contest entries; these are anonymous and randomized for each person. You‚Äôll be given a limited number of votes that you can use to boost your favorite designs. Votes cannot be withdrawn once cast, so choose carefully! WAITING FOR RESULTS Stage: Highrise Staff will review and assemble the top-voted entries into a list of finalists. Hang tight - we‚Äôll notify you when this stage is over! FINAL VOTE Stage: Cast your ballot for the top entry! Navigate through the Browse feature to pick your favorite entry from among the finalists. You‚Äôll only have one vote, and you won‚Äôt be able to take it back once cast, so choose carefully! WINNERS ANNOUNCED Stage: Check back in to view the contest winners and runner ups! At this point, no other entries will be visible, but you can still view your own designs by tabbing back to My Submissions. Frequently Asked Questions If entries are anonymous, can I still add my name to my submission? Yes! You may watermark your design with your name or logo. Sharing your design on your profile via a newsfeed post is also allowed, so feel free to chat about your entries. However, remember that offering Gold or other incentives to the community to vote on your entry is not allowed, and will get you disqualified. I want to delete my entry! How!? While you‚Äôre in the UDC web tool, tab over to ‚ÄúMy Submissions.‚Äù Long press on the entry you want to delete to pull up the action menu. I accidentally voted for an entry I totally hate. Can I take my vote back? Nope! Sorry about that pal, but all votes are final. Choose carefully! I'm getting a weird error message when I try to submit! Make sure your image dimensions don't exceed 1080x1080! You won't be able to submit your entry if your images are too big, so get them down to size to enter the contest.",

We love to collaborate with players to design items for our world, and we‚Äôll always attribute player-inspired items to their designer. There are two ways that we find and feature players‚Äô creations. 1. Design Contest Winners We frequently host official design competitions; you can learn more in the FAQ under ‚ÄúHighrise Competitions and Rules.‚Äù When a player wins a design competition and we make their items in the game, we‚Äôll make an attribution note on the bottom of the item preview. This note will say ‚ÄúInspired by‚Äù with a link to the designer‚Äôs username. If an item you designed is missing attribution, reach out to our Concierge team to update it. Please include the contest and event the item is from and whether it was released in a grab, shop collection, or event rewards. 2. Other player-inspired items Sometimes we discover an outstanding player-designed item outside of a competition. It might be a random drawing, or a competition entry didn‚Äôt make it into a grab. If we decide to add one of these items to the game, we‚Äôll reach out to notify the player directly, and they‚Äôll receive compensation when the item is released. These items will also get a note of attribution at the bottom of the item preview. What to do if you think Highrise used a design without crediting the player An item will only have an attribution note if it was designed or inspired by a player; all other items are designed by artists on our staff. It‚Äôs not unusual for our art team and our players to find inspiration in similar trends and create similar designs independently by complete coincidence- this phenomenon is sometimes called parallel thinking. Most of the time, our staff isn‚Äôt aware of players‚Äô designs when developing items, and draw inspiration from and reference sources outside of the app such as fashion retailers, photos and illustrations on Pinterest and Instagram, Google image search, and even real life. In this case, a player who designs a similar item isn‚Äôt entitled to any type of compensation or attribution. If you find an item in the game appears to be directly inspired by a player but doesn‚Äôt have proper attribution, please contact our Concierge team! Our Concierge team and staff artists will review these reports and determine if attribution is due or if it‚Äôs an instance of parallel thinking. Our staff respects the creative community of Highrise, and will always give credit where it is due.",

        "content": "We love seeing your ideas come to life in events, so why not share the love even more with Mini Design Contests? These competitions are a separate category from Grab Design Contests - check the FAQ for more information on those. Items designed for Mini Design Contests are typically featured in Item Collections and other shop pages. Winners always receive the items they designed that made it into the game for free! Here are some rules and guidelines to help clarify some of the most common questions we have about Grab Design Contests. Please note that this applies primarily to mini contests and some guidelines may differ for our grab contests. Mini Design Contest rules: All entries must be your original creation. You may incorporate art assets from Highrise or other sources to help express your idea, however, you must significantly change or add to it in order to make it your own unique design. Entering images directly from other games, avatar creator apps, art sites, Instagram, etc. is not allowed. Designs depicting copyrighted characters or other IPs will be disqualified. Unless specifically stated as a collaboration, you may not enter artwork created by other members. Commissioned designs will be disqualified. Mini Design Contests may call for entries to include anywhere from 1-10 unique items, depending on the contest. If a contest calls for a range of items, you can choose the number of items you‚Äôd like to submit, and you may also enter up to 2 separate, unique submissions . However, only one of your designs may become a finalist. All avatar items must be clearly visible in your entry. Items that are unclear or obscured may be modified or left out of the final lineup. Final entries must be submitted through the User Design Contest feature, available through a bot in the Welcome Plaza All designs must follow the Highrise code of conduct and community guidelines. Offensive or exclusionary content won‚Äôt be considered - we want to highlight entries that reflect the values of our community All submissions will be regarded as User-Generated Content as defined in the Pocket Worlds Terms of Service . By submitting a design, you acknowledge Highrise will own the rights to the finished items, and that your compensation will take the form of free items and/or gold. Contest judging: After the contest deadline has passed, Highrise staff will review all contest entries under the contest hashtag and select a number of finalists. Finalist selection is based on a combination of factors. This can include: Visual appeal Uniqueness of design Interpretation of theme Feasibility (Can Highrise actually make your items work in-game within our current technical constraints?) Community interest As of March 2021, judging takes into consideration an entry's popularity within the community, including number of likes and comments. We don‚Äôt allow consecutive wins in any art design contest. If you have been selected as a winner in a Mini Design Contest, you are not eligible to be selected as a winner in the next Mini Design Contest. Winners who enter the following contest under an alternate account will be disqualified. Collaborations that include a finalist from the previous contest are only eligible for a shoutout spot. Winners are announced 1-2 days after the contest deadline. What's my prize for winning? Bragging rights, of course! Just kidding, you get more than street cred for winning a Mini Contest. Winning creators will receive a gold prize and the items inspired by their design. Sometimes we‚Äôll also highlight some designers as Runners-Up or Shoutouts who will receive a gold prize. If you are part of a collaboration , we‚Äôll divide the spoils equally amongst you and your partner. I'm a winner of a mini design contest! What happens now? Congrats! Now your design will be used by our Art Team as inspiration for real in-game items üòÉ Once winners have been announced, please email us by going to Profile > Settings > FAQ > Contact Us in top-right corner > Community Requests.  Open a new message and include HD images of your design and any close-ups or detail views, along with any additional notes or instructions for our staff artists. For winning designs, include a full list of items. It helps us a lot when items are clearly labeled. When your items release, you'll them along with your gold prize in form of gift boxes under the Gifts section of your Inbox. Enjoy! Design Contest Do‚Äôs and Dont‚Äôs - DO: Make your entire design cohesive. It helps when everything in your design makes sense with the theme and fits together well. There are many ways to achieve this, such as using a particular color palette or specific design elements throughout the design, having a strong central concept/story/aesthetic/mood, etc. If something seems out of place, it might be better to change it or leave it out. Create a variety of masculine, feminine, and gender-neutral items. We‚Äôre always looking to spice up our inventories with items inspired by diverse sources, so push your creativity! Present your design clearly and neatly. To keep the contest hashtag free of clutter and easy to navigate, please post your entry as a multi-image post. The first image of your post must show your full design. Include close-ups and detail views in the rest of your post instead of making separate posts. If something is covered up in your design, include a detail view of it by itself so we can see the whole item. Pay attention to how items usually work on the avatar. There are technical limitations that affect the way items layer and animate in our system. Designs that will not work well with our system will need to be modified or combined, which may affect your item count. Refer to the Current Avatar Item Layering Guide in the FAQ for more info. Include a few different items! Untag any old versions of your entry. We just want to see your most beautiful and polished final design on the contest hashtag page. Be supportive of everyone participating! Be kind and thoughtful when giving or receiving feedback, and congratulate each others' successes. DO NOT: Use the UDC to submit posts that are NOT your final entry. Don't tag your sneak peeks, WIPs, close-ups, and other non-final entry posts with the contest hashtag. This clutters up the Browse page and makes it difficult for us to find your actual final entries. If you would like to show close-ups and detail shots, please include them as part of your main entry post. Change or add to your design after the entry submission has closed. Any additional artwork submitted afterward will not be considered. Encourage other people to repost your design to show support. This makes it harder to find your original post, as well as cluttering up the UDC Browse page. Host giveaways in exchange for likes/comments/reposts on your entry. People should be voting on your entry because they enjoy your design, not because they might win something from you. Members who host giveaways in exchange for votes will be disqualified from the contest. Remake existing items, especially ones that are valuable or high rarity. Resubmit entries from past contests. Think of each contest as an opportunity to practice and improve your design skills. While resubmitted designs are allowed, these designs have a much lower chance of being selected.",

        "content": "We love giving the community a chance to showcase their creative talents by designing items for the game! Winning player designs will be used as inspiration for an official Highrise grab, and runners-up get a small selection of their items turned into rewards. Winners always receive the items they designed for free! That being said, here are a few rules and guidelines to help clarify some of the most common questions we have about Grab Design Contests. Please note that this applies primarily to full Grab Design Contests; rules differ for Mini Design Contests, so check the FAQ for more information. Grab Design Contest rules: All entries must be your original creation. You may incorporate art assets from Highrise or other sources to help express your idea, and we accept the use of tracing and other drawing aids. However, any entry you submit must be significantly changed from your reference material in order to make it your own unique design. Entering images directly from other games, avatar creator apps, art sites, Instagram, etc. is not allowed. Designs depicting copyrighted characters or other IPs will be disqualified. Unless specifically stated as a collaboration, you may not enter artwork created by other members. Commissioned grab designs will be disqualified. Each design must include at least 1 masculine outfit and 1 feminine outfit. All designs must have a minimum of 12 items in total (both genders combined) and a maximum of 15. More items may be included in the design, but no more than 15 will be made in the final grab. All avatar items must be clearly visible in your entry. Items that are unclear or obscured may be modified or left out of the final grab. Furni is optional. You may include up to 2 furni items. These will count toward the 12 item minimum. These should be visible in the main entry image, but do not have to be full size. Having furni in your design does not affect your chances of being selected as a finalist. Highrise reserves the right to modify, combine, or remove any items in a design. This may be done for technical reasons or to make the item fit better in the style of the app You may submit up to 2 unique entries for a design contest. However, only one of your designs may become a finalist for community voting. Collaborative efforts are counted as a single entry, so plan your solo and team submissions accordingly. Final entries must be submitted through the User Design Contest feature, available through a bot in the Welcome Plaza All designs must follow the Highrise code of conduct and community guidelines. Offensive or exclusionary content won‚Äôt be considered - we want to highlight entries that reflect the values of our community All submissions will be regarded as User-Generated Content as defined in the Pocket Worlds Terms of Service . By submitting a design, you acknowledge Highrise will own the rights to the finished items, and that your compensation will take the form of free items and/or gold. Use of official Highrise avatar templates is highly encouraged, but not required. You can find the template here: Contest judging: After the contest deadline has passed, Highrise staff will review all contest entries under the contest hashtag and select a number of finalists. Finalist selection is based on a combination of factors. This can include: Visual appeal Uniqueness of design Interpretation of theme Feasibility (Can Highrise actually make your items work in-game within our current technical constraints?) Community interest As of March 2021, judging takes into consideration an entry's popularity within the community, including number of likes and comments. We don‚Äôt allow consecutive wins in any art design contest. If you have been selected as a winner or runner-up in a Grab Design Contest, you are not eligible to be selected as a finalist in the next Grab Design Contest. Finalists who enter the following contest under an alternate account will be disqualified. Collaborations that include a finalist from the previous contest are only eligible for a shoutout spot. Winners may participate in a MIni Design Contest immediately following a win in a Grab Design Contest. For more information, visit the Mini Design Contest FAQ Finalists are announced 1-2 days after the contest deadline. The Highrise community will then have 24 hours to vote for their favorite designs from those finalists. What's my prize for winning or being a runner-up? Winners will receive a gold prize along with the full item set inspired by their design. Runners-up will receive a gold prize and a small number of items (around 4)  from their design. If you‚Äôre part of a winning collaboration, discuss with your teammate how you would like your item set divided between you. Grabs made from collaborator designs may be smaller than the 15 item maximum to allow items to be equally distributed. Gold prizes will also be divided equally between collaborators. Outside of the winners and runners-up, we also select a number of designs as Honorable Mentions or Shoutouts for each contest. These players will receive a gold prize. I'm a winner/runner up for a grab design contest! What happens now? Congrats! Now your design will be used by our Art Team as inspiration for real in-game items üòÉ Once winners and runner-ups have been announced, please email us by going to Profile > Settings > FAQ > Contact Us in top-right corner > Community Requests.  Open a new message and include HD images of your full design and any close-ups or detail views, along with any additional notes or instructions for our staff artists. For winning designs, include a full list of items as well as intended rarities. It helps us a lot when items are clearly labeled. Feel free to include items names as well, but remember: HR has the final say in item selection, name, and rarity For runner-up designs, include a full list of items listed in order of preference. Typically only 4 items will be made from runner-up designs. Our staff will determine which items will be made, but we try to honor requests and preferences where possible. Usually, we send designers 2 sets of their items. If you‚Äôre a collaborator, we'll send each partner 1 set, along with half the gold prize. We'll usually send you some previews of your items before they go live, along with their expected launch date. Please note that we typically do not send previews for single item contests (EyeRise, Redesign, etc) due to the volume of participants. Winning designs will be released as grabs that can be spun with gold. Items made from runners-up will be released as event rewards. You'll receive your items and gold prize in-game in the form of gift boxes under the Gifts section of your Inbox. Enjoy! Design Contest Do‚Äôs and Dont‚Äôs - DO: Make your entire grab design cohesive. It helps when everything in your design makes sense with the theme and fits together well. There are many ways to achieve this, such as using a particular color palette or specific design elements throughout the design, having a strong central concept/story/aesthetic/mood, etc. If something seems out of place, it might be better to change it or leave it out. Put equal effort into both feminine and masculine outfits. Are they both equally interesting and well thought out, or has more effort been put into one over the other? A super elaborate feminine outfit doesn‚Äôt make up for a very basic masculine one. Push your creativity! Present your design clearly and neatly. To keep the contest hashtag free of clutter and easy to navigate, please post your entry as a multi-image post. The first image of your post must show your full design with both outfits. Include close ups and detail views in the rest of your post instead of making separate posts. If something is covered up in your design, include a detail view of it by itself so we can see the whole item. Consider a variety of rarities when designing your items. Are there any items in your design that are particularly unique, fun, beautiful, etc? Are there items that stand out as obvious Legendaries or Epics, or does everything feel like Rares? Pay attention to how items usually work on the avatar. There are technical limitations that affect the way items layer and animate in our system. Designs that will not work well with our system will need to be modified or combined, which may affect your item count. Refer to the Current Avatar Item Layering Guide in the FAQ for more info. Include more than 12 items! 12 is the minimum required, but we often need to combine certain member-designed items because of technical constraints. This could cause your design to have fewer than 12 items in total, which unfortunately disqualifies the entry. Untag any old versions of your entry. We just want to see your most beautiful and polished final design on the contest hashtag page. Be supportive of everyone participating! Be kind and thoughtful when giving or receiving feedback, and congratulate each others' successes. DO NOT: Use the UDC to submit posts that are NOT your final entry. Don't tag your sneak peeks, WIPs, close ups, and other non-final entry posts with the contest hashtag. This clutters up the Browse page and makes it difficult for us to find your actual final entries. If you would like to show close ups and detail shots, please include them as part of your main entry post. Change or add to your design after entry submission has closed. Any additional artwork submitted afterwards will not be considered. Encourage other people to repost your design to show support. This makes it harder to find your original post, as well as cluttering up the UDC Browse page. Host giveaways in exchange for likes/comments/reposts on your entry. People should be leaving likes and comments because they enjoy your design, not because they might win something from you. Members who host giveaways in exchange for likes and comments on their entries will be disqualified from the contest. Remake existing items, especially ones that are valuable or high rarity. Items that are too similar to existing ones may be excluded from the final grab, but will not disqualify an entire design. Resubmit entries from past contests. Think of each contest as an opportunity to practice and improve your design skills. While resubmitted designs are allowed, these designs have a much lower chance of being selected.",

        "content": "Depending on the circumstances, you might experience an error while trying to verify your account. The errors begin with a number. We will cover all errors in this article and the best way to solve them: Error 113 Error 113 ‚Äì The Verification System detects that the Highrise account is already connected to the Discord Server. This can occur when a user is already verified, has multiple Highrise accounts, or has recently granted another user access to their account. Solution First, check to make sure you‚Äôre not already verified by checking if you have the ‚ÄúHighrise Verified‚Äù role assigned. If you can see the #verification channel in the channels list, then you are not verified yet. ‚Äã If you‚Äôre not already verified, check to see if you receive a pop-up that asks you to verify. The pop-up should look similar to this: Check to see if the Discord username (including the hashtag) in the pop-up matches the current one you‚Äôre logged into and are currently using in our official Discord server. If the username differs, click ‚ÄúNot you?‚Äù and log back in using the correct credentials. Then, attempt to complete the verification process again. Alternatively, if you do not receive this pop-up, try going to https://highrise.game/settings , pressing ‚ÄúLogin‚Äù at the top right of the screen, and enter your Highrise credentials. From here, check to see if your Highrise account is linked to a Discord account. If there is a Discord account linked, press ‚ÄúUnlink‚Äù and attempt to complete the verification process within the server again. If you are unable to find a link to your main Highrise account, try logging out of the website (press on your character‚Äôs image at the top right, and then Log Out) and attempt to log back in with the credentials of your alternative account(s). Navigate to https://highrise.game/account/settings again and check to see if there‚Äôs a Discord account linked. If so, press ‚ÄúUnlink.‚Äù  Then, go back to the Discord Server and attempt to complete the verification process again. If you still receive Error 113 and are unable to find a Discord account linked to any of your Highrise accounts, please open a ticket within the Discord Server under #verification-help Error 114 Error 114 ‚Äì The Verification System detects that the Discord account you‚Äôre attempting to link is already connected to a Highrise account. This can occur when a user has more than one Discord account, Highrise account, or has recently granted another user access to their account. Solution When attempting to complete the verification process, check to see if you receive a pop-up that asks you to verify. The pop-up should look similar to this: Check to see if the Discord username (including the hashtag) in the pop-up matches the current one you‚Äôre logged into and currently using in our official Discord server.

Solution Wait 24 hours then try to complete the verification process again. Error 118 Error 118 ‚Äì  The Verification System detects that the Discord account you‚Äôre attempting to verify with is not the same one that you have inside our Discord server. This can occur when a user owns more than one Discord account and is logged in the wrong one. Solution When attempting to complete the verification process, check to see if you receive a pop-up that asks you to verify. The pop-up should look similar to this: Ensure the Discord username (including the hashtag) in the pop-up matches the current one you‚Äôre logged into. If the username differs, click ‚ÄúNot you?‚Äù and log back in using the correct credentials. Then, attempt to complete the verification process again. If you still receive Error 118 and are unable to find a Discord account linked to any of your Highrise accounts, try logging into Discord through the web browser https://discord.com/ and attempt to complete the verification process again. If you still are unable to verify, please open a ticket within the Discord Server under #verification-help Error 119 Error 119 ‚Äì The Verification System detects that you‚Äôre attempting to verify a Highrise account that has been suspended or banned. Solution You can contact Highrise Support to appeal the ban or suspension through [email¬†protected] or use this form and choose the banned/suspended option: https://highrise.helpshift.com/hc/en/3-highrise---your-avatar-community/contact-us/ Error 120 Error 120 ‚Äì The Verification System detects that the Highrise account you‚Äôre attempting to verify has not been active recently.

If you still are unable to verify, please open a ticket within the Discord Server under #verification-help Error 401 Error 401 ‚Äì The Verification System detects that the authorization process was cancelled. Solution To ensure you can verify, please first authorize permission to access your Discord account. Ensure your Discord username and hashtag ID match identically to the one it asks you to authorize permissions for. If you receive a pop-up that asks you to verify; the pop-up should look similar to this: Ensure the Discord username (including the hashtag) in the pop-up matches the current one you‚Äôre logged into. If the username differs, click ‚ÄúNot you?‚Äù and log back in using the correct credentials. Then, attempt to complete the verification process again. If you still are unable to verify, please open a ticket within the Discord Server under #verification-help Connection Error This error is often a result of browser and network setting issues. Extensions, Ad-blockers, and Anti-virus use as well as VPNs, Proxies, public Wi-Fi, or Mobile data connections can interfere with the verification process.

        "category": "Highrise Concepts",
        "content": "Questions Q: How - and why - is this different from our current Design Contest? A: Concepts empowers not only our artists, but our entire community, to shape the direction of all Highrise art. An updated scoring system gives everyone a better chance to influence a Concept‚Äôs winning designs, and by sharing our staff‚Äôs designs before they‚Äôre released, we can dissolve the boundaries between ‚Äúofficial‚Äù and community designs. Concepts lets everyone share in the experience of creating and watching as your favorite items travel from idea to your closet. Q: Do we still get items, gold, and Inspired By Attribution? A: Yes! For now, we‚Äôre retaining much of the structure of our current Design Contest prize distribution. Unless otherwise stated, all winning Concept artists will receive 5 copies of each item they make and 5k gold per item. Sometimes, we‚Äôll run special Concepts with cash payouts (as in the case of Sale items). Our team will let you know what information we‚Äôll need to send your compensation. Q: I want to support my friend's design by voting for them. How do I find a specific submission? A. Every artist needs an audience who supports their creative endeavors! However, Concepts is not about seeking out specific entries. Rather, the feature was designed to help level the playing field and prevent any design from rising to the top based on the popularity of the designer. Every submission is randomly paired, which means that every single entry stands a fair chance of acheiving a high rating using the Elo scoring system. Q: You mention that Concepts can allow simultaneous Submission and Voting phases. How is that fair? Won't earlier submissions get more votes? A. Technically, yes. BUT, total votes does not equal a higher score. That's the magic of Elo! The Elo rating system is designed to predict the outcome of a matchup. If an entry is performing well, it will fall in the ranks quickly if a new contender consistently defeats it in a matchup. This allows for a newer submission to quickly gain a higher score than older submissions, if it's performing well. While Concepts does allow the possibility of a simultaneous Submission and Voting phase, for our first Concept (Artist's Lounge), we'll be keeping the two phases separate. General Guidelines WHAT TO SUBMIT Every Concept will have a brief description of the theme and item type you should create, but these are only starting points: your vision is at the heart of this feature, and of Highrise as a whole. Medium: Feel free to create your Concept using pen and paper, Photoshop, Illustrator, Procreate, or any other medium you‚Äôre most comfortable with. Re-entries: If one of your Concepts or Contest designs doesn‚Äôt get selected, you may resubmit your Concept art to any number of relevant Concepts. However, please stay on theme! Originality: Your work should be your own. Any artwork lifted from Instagram, DeviantArt, or other art communities will be disqualified, as will designs depicting copyrighted characters or other IPs. Drawing Assistance: You may use references, drawing aids, and staff-made Highrise items as bases in your Concepts. We‚Äôre looking for good ideas, which is not necessarily the same thing as good art! Redesigns: You may submit a redesign of any existing staff-made Highrise item in your Concept, regardless of the Concept‚Äôs theme. Player Items: Anyone may freely use Highrise items designed by staff as references and in redesigned items. However, you may not trace items designed by other players. Please report any designs you believe to be using player material, and our team will review the submission. All submissions will be regarded as User-Generated Content as defined in the Pocket Worlds Terms of Service . By submitting a design, you acknowledge Highrise will own the rights to the finished items, and that your compensation will take the form of free items and/or gold. CREATE MULTIPLE SUBMISSIONS Got lots of ideas? Great! Share multiple concepts in multiple submissions. This is to help ensure that when someone views your concept, they are able to clearly identify the item they‚Äôre voting for. We‚Äôve increased the maximum number of total submissions you can create to account for the new Elo scoring system. Help us keep Concepts fair! COLLABORATIONS It‚Äôs dangerous to go alone! Take a partner - if you like. Collaborations are allowed in Concepts, but for now, collaborations are limited to dynamic duos only. If you have a partner, please have only one person submit your shared Concept, and add your partner‚Äôs name on the entry. Our messenger only supports 1-1 conversations, so please keep in mind that whoever submits your Concept will be responsible for all communication with our team. Additionally, we do not increase total compensation (items, gold) for collaborations. When dividing your prize items, we‚Äôll split your total as evenly as we can, and send any spillover items to the artist who submitted the Concept. For example, if everyone gets 5x copies of their item, the submitter will receive 3, and their partner will receive 2. Feel free to redistribute the items and gold afterward! BE REAL Attempts to artificially boost your score by offering gold or other incentives in exchange for gold is not allowed. Additionally, any other malicious behaviors outlined in our Community Guidelines (ie, witch-hunting, newsfeed campaigns against another artist, etc) may also result in your disqualification from a Concept, and possibly lead to a mute, suspension, or a ban. Tips Looking for more info on how to create Highrise items? Check out our Avatar Item Layering Guide in the FAQ for more info! Teamwork makes the dream work! When communicating with Highrise Staff through the Concepts messenger, please be respectful and remember that we‚Äôre all in this together, and all want to see Highrise continue to evolve into its best self. Worried about whether your Concept suits a theme? Don‚Äôt be! No one will ever get disqualified for trying something new, or slightly misinterpreting a Concept‚Äôs prompt. In any case, the people will decide whether your design matches a theme or not, and bubble up the best, most creative entries.",

When the Concept ends, you‚Äôll receive a message from our team, and your winning submission will get a groovy new SELECTED banner across the top.

Our team will share updates on how your concept is progressing and ask questions as they come up. When your concept is ready for preview, we‚Äôll share a sneak peek for your review. ‚Äã ‚Äã A Special Note for Collaborators Currently, our Messenger only supports chat with the artist who submitted the winning design. We're working to add functionality to create a multi-way chat for collaborators, but until then, please coordinate with your partner to view previews and share feedback! As a quick heads up, our production turnaround is pretty speedy. When we send previews, please share any edit requests with us as soon as possible; ideally, within 48 hours. Also, keep in mind that even if you send edit requests right away, we can‚Äôt guarantee that all changes will be implemented, due to an array of possible blockers (like technical layering issues, stylistic choices, time constraints, or significant departures from your original winning concept). The Concepts messenger will close for your winning Submission about a week after your items go live. If you have any other feedback or concerns about your items after this period, please reach out to our Support Team for assistance. After all edits are complete and your items are ready, we‚Äôll send them to you as an Inbox Gift about 48 hours before they‚Äôre due to go live.",

        "content": "Navigate to the Concept theme of your choice, and tap the Upload Submission button to begin. Creating your Submission You‚Äôll be prompted to Upload Photos from your library, camera, or files. You can upload up to 5 images per Submission. The number of total Submissions will vary per contest, but will typically land around 10 or so. Consider each Submission a separate entity. For example, if the Concept you‚Äôre entering asks for a face item, and you have created designs for eyes, lips, and a nose, use one submission for each item. This is to help keep the Concepts process more fair, clear, and easier for everyone to actually pick the items they want! Once you‚Äôve chosen the photos for your Submission, you can either add more, or delete from your current selection. If you‚Äôd like to reorder your images, you‚Äôll have to delete and reupload your photos in the proper order. Entering Your Submission When you‚Äôve finalized the images you‚Äôd like to use for your Submission, you‚Äôll be given a preview. Tap Create. You can view your submissions any time from within the Concept card page. Add another entry by tapping the + sign. Change your mind about a submission? Navigate to My Submissions, tap on the entry you‚Äôd like to delete, and tap Delete Submission. FAQ Q: I‚Äôm getting an error when uploading! What went wrong? A: First, be sure to check your internet connection. We know, this is a boring tip - but it‚Äôs often the issue! Next, try to exit out of the Concepts page and re-enter the My Submissions portal to confirm your entry isn‚Äôt there. Finally, be sure to check that all your image size does not exceed 5MB. Q: I have more than 10 concept ideas! Can my submissions show all my ideas at once? A: Um no. Help us ensure that voting is accurate! Please keep each submission limited to one concept apiece. For grabs, this means using one Submission per grab concept; in the case of single-item Concepts, each item should be its own submission. You can still use a clothed avatar as a model for your design, and share multiple examples of how it might look with different outfit combinations. However, your first slide should always clearly label or highlight your actual design. Q: Can I edit my Submissions after voting has begun? A: You won‚Äôt be able to update the images in a submission after you create it. If you need to change the artwork or order of your slides, you‚Äôll have to create a new Submission. Accidentally delete a concept after the submisison period is over? No worries! Reach out to our Support team. We can restore your deleted submission!",

        "category": "Highrise Concepts",
        "content": "When you vote, you‚Äôll be presented with two random designs. If a design has more than one image, view additional slides by swiping right-to-left. Pick your favorite! Tap on an entry to select it, and tap again to confirm your choice. After you confirm, you‚Äôll be presented with a new pair of concepts. Votes are infinite, so keep reviewing concepts as long as you‚Äôd like - or until supper calls ü•™ FAQ Q: How are votes counted in Concepts? A: This tool uses ELO rating! This style of scoring gives each entry a score that increases and decreases depending on its total wins over a series of matchups; importantly, in this system each vote carries a different weight depending on the ranks of the two competitors. For example, an entry will receive a modest impact to its score when paired against an entry with an equal rating. But if a highly voted entry is paired against a low voted entry, it will receive a bigger hit to its score - and the lower voted entry will receive a bigger bonus. This system is also what allows us to run voting alongside an open submission period, as votes are not tallied via total quantity, but rather by total score. A new, recently submitted design will always have a chance to rise through the ranks if it receives enough attention! Unless you submit like, an hour before the contest ends. In that case, good luck kid. Read more about the system here ! Q: How are designs matched up? Is it all random? A: All pairs are random. None of the following will affect pairing or order of appearance: Time of entry Current score Whether you‚Äôve seen an entry before Whether you approved or disapproved an entry Who submitted the design Q: Can I see what I‚Äôve voted for? A: Right now, we do not have a system in place for retaining an index of your votes. Additionally, there is no navigation for going back to rescind a vote, or bookmarks to revisit an entry later. Go with the flow, and let your feelings guide you! Q: Can I skip if I don't like my choices? A. Nope! The idea behind Concepts is to give every single design an equal chance of being seen. The A or B voting mechanic should bubble up the best designs over time; which means that every vote you cast matters. When voting, you're not picking the overall best entries, but evaluating two concepts side-by-side in order to share your impressions of their quality relative to each other. By voting on each entry, you help to give us an accurate read on how well the community is resonating with a particular design. Q: How do I report an entry? A: Report an entry for violating our Community Guidelines by tapping the red flag in the upper left corner. Please share a comment on why you are submitting your report in the text box, and then hit Submit to send your report to our dedicated Trust & Safety team.",

        "content": "Concepts is an evolved version of our current UDC (User Design Contest) tool. The Concepts hub currently lives on our website highrise.game - here, community members can view and submit item ideas for designated themes. üëâWhere Concepts departs from the UDC model is that it allows A or B voting, a different vote scoring system, and even simultaneous submission and voting. When someone wants to view and vote on the submitted artwork for a Concept, they‚Äôll be presented with two entries at once, and will choose their favorite between the two. Yes, this is just like our Style Challenge voting! Also like our Style Challenges, scoring will be determined through ELO rating . Not only is this system a better indicator of what resonates with the community, but it also allows us to open any concept‚Äôs submission period to run concurrently with its voting stage (since submitting early to gain more votes is no longer an issue). Additionally, this system elevates art based on the merit of the design alone. By reducing the impact of a player's popularity on their total votes, lesser-known creators have a better chance of getting noticed. ùôèùôùùôö ùôíùôÉùôî: In keeping with our vision of a Highrise entirely built by the community, we want to move toward a future where content moves in a transparent pipeline from sketch, to vector, to real item, with your innovation, intuition, and insight as key influences every step of the way. Concepts lets you take a far more active role in choosing what kind of content gets released. By participating in the scoring process and bubbling up the best designs, you can let us know early on if a concept is in high demand and should be put into production. Additionally, our Art Team will be using HR Concepts to submit their own art sketches to the voting pool, so we can all collaborate as a community on what kinds of looks we like the best. We‚Äôre imagining a future where everyone can get involved in choosing what gets released!",

        "category": "Events",
        "content": "What happens in an event? In events, you can compete to earn limited-edition prizes every week. Participate in each event's unique play style to win tickets, the more tickets you earn, the more you win! What are the different types of events in Highrise? Highrise features three main event styles: Style Challenge : Compete as a Model or Judge in fashion challenges. Prank : Engage in playful pranking for rewards. Donate : Collect and donate items to NPCs. How do I earn tickets for playing events? You can earn tickets by participating in event activities, that vary depending on the event type. Why should I earn tickets? For prizes! The more tickets you accumulate, the higher your rank and the better the rewards. Party Time What is Party Time? Party Time is a special ticket bonus buff that occurs every 6 hours. During this 30-minute time window, you earn a 30% bonus on tickets. In Prank and Donate events, you can use Rocket Fuel to start Party Time anytime. Note that Rocket Fuel stacks to your current party time amount but does not reset your next party time bonus buff cooldown. Event Shop & Item Collections What can I buy in the Event Shop? In the event shop, you can purchase batteries for energy refills, Rocket Fuel for Party Time, Magic Glasses for Style Challenge, and Helper Items for Prank and Donate events. What is the Lucky Wheel? You can spin the Lucky Wheel during an event for a chance to win event items, the same ones you‚Äôd find in the event shop! Boosts How do I get boosts? Spend Lucky Tokens on the Boost bar Obtain items from the event‚Äôs grab that offer boosts Do all items contribute to boosts? No: only items with an indicator displaying a boost for a particular event will provide bonus tickets. Usually, we offer 1-3 boosted event grabs, and boosted items may also be found in special event sales. For Prank & Donate events you can find items in our lucky grab that offer boosts as well, though these will only contribute a max of 4 lucky token items to your boost. Account-bound items obtained via Promo Tokens do not contribute towards your boost. Note: there is a maximum 20-item limit for combined boosts, and boosted items are NOT tradable during events! Items with boost become tradable after the event ends Ranks and Rewards How are rewards determined? Most events offer rewards in these categories (based on ticket count): Participation Individual Ranked Crew Ranked In Style Challenges, Individual Ranked rewards are broken down further into Model and Judge Rewards. Respectively, these are earned by achieving a high approval rating for your modeled outfit, and for consistent performance in the Judging portion of the event. Common Issues & Questions Boost items not counting? Boost is calculated from your top boosting items; account-bound promo items don‚Äôt count. There is also a maximum cap on boost, this cap may vary each event and will always be displayed on the event HUD. Do lucky tokens expire? Yes, any lucky tokens left over when an event ends will expire and not carry over to the next event. So make sure to use them up! If I leave my crew, do my tickets carry over? No, if you leave your crew, and join a new crew, your ticket contribution will start at 0 in your new crew. Can I kick someone from my Crew during an event? No, you cannot kick crew members during an active event. This is something we have in place to prevent abuse.

        "category": "Creature Club",
        "content": "‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Purchasing Highrise Creatures is done at your own risk. Blockchain technology is still new and evolving, and there is a risk of scams and other malicious activities. Please stay informed about basic security measures, such as using strong passwords and two-factor authentication, and only use services from trusted sources. To purchase a Highrise Creature Club NFT, you will need a Metamask wallet, crypto currency, and to be informed about the basic security measures of the blockchain technology. ‚Äã You can follow the steps below: Step 1: Create a Metamask Wallet A MetaMask wallet is like a digital bank account for your crypto currency. It allows you to store and manage your ETH (Ether) and other digital tokens in a secure, easy-to-use way. You can use your MetaMask wallet to purchase Highrise Creature Club NFTs and access all the perks and benefits that come with being a part of the club. You should use a computer to use and create a MetaMask Wallete. It's the easiest and most safe way, and you should follow these steps: Install the MetaMask browser extension from the official website ( https://metamask.io ) or from the Chrome Web Store. Click the MetaMask icon in your browser to open the extension. Click the \"Create a Wallet\" button on the welcome screen. Enter a strong password to protect your wallet and click \"Create\". Make sure to write down your password and store it in a safe place. Read and accept the terms of use and privacy policy, then click \"All Done\". You will be shown your MetaMask seed phrase, which is a series of 12-24 words that can be used to restore your wallet if you forget your password or lose access to your account. Write down your seed phrase and store it in a safe place. ‚ö†Ô∏è This seed phrase can give anyone permanent full access to your account. Losing it means losing access to your account. Anyone with access to it can also have access to all the assets stored in your wallet. No one will ever ask you to share this information unless they‚Äôre trying to scam you. Click the \"Next\" button to continue. You will be taken to your MetaMask wallet, where you can view your accounts, transaction history, and other information. Step 2: Connect your wallet to Immutable X: Immutable X is the marketplace where the Highrise Creatures can be purchased. Once you have created a Metamask wallet and added funds, you need to connect your wallet to Immutable X. Here‚Äôs how to connect your wallet to Immutable X: Visit https://market.immutable.com/ and press the blue ‚ÄúConnect Wallet‚Äù button at the top right of the screen. Choose the Metamask option. A Metamask popup will show up, press ‚ÄúNext‚Äù, and then ‚ÄúConnect‚Äù. Then go back to the Immutable X website, and press ‚ÄúGet Started‚Äù. A new Metamask popup will show up, press ‚ÄúNext‚Äù and ‚ÄúConnect‚Äù once again. And then press ‚ÄúSign‚Äù. Your Metamask wallet should now be connected to Immutable X. Step 3: Add funds to Immutable X: To purchase Highrise Creatures on Immutable X, you first need to purchase ETH (the crypto currency used to purchase Highrise Creatures.) After your wallet has been connected to the Immutable website, ( https://market.immutable.com/ ) press Balance, at the top right of the screen, and then press ‚ÄúAdd funds‚Äù. The easiest way to add funds is using the first option: Credit Card. Simply choose how much ETH you want to buy, and follow the on-screen steps to checkout. After purchasing your funds will be added to Immutable X instantly. Alternatively, you can purchase ETH directly through MetaMask in some countries, or by using exchange apps such as Coinbase, Gemini, Moonpay, Shakepay, Binance, and Crypto.com . If you have purchased ETH using one of these alternatives, you need to transfer it to Immutable X to be able to use it: Visit the Immutable X website ( https://market.immutable.com/ ) press Balance, at the top right of the screen, and then press ‚ÄúAdd funds‚Äù. Choose ‚ÄúDeposit from Wallet‚Äù. Select the ‚ÄúEthereum (ETH)‚Äù currency from the list. Choose the amount of ETH that you want to transfer from your Metamask Wallet to your Immutable X wallet. Press Confirm. A Metamask popup will show up on your screen to confirm and sign the transaction. Note: Transferring ETH requires a small gas fee to process the transaction. To learn more about gas and gas fees, check out: https://defiprime.com/gas Step 4: Purchase a Creature: Choose the Creature that you would like to purchase from the TokenTrove marketplace ( https://tokentrove.com/collection/Highrise ) Press ‚ÄúBuy now‚Äù to instantly buy the Creature, or ‚ÄúMake an offer‚Äù, if you would like to make a different price offer to the owner of the Creature. Then follow the on-screen steps. ‚ö†Ô∏è NEVER click the option to withdraw your Creature NFT. Completing this process will result in the permanent loss of your Creature. Reminder: Creatures are only visible within your Immutable X/TokenTrove inventory as they require a layer-two blockchain for compatibility. They are not visible within your Metamask wallet. Step 5: Connect your Metamask wallet to your Highrise account: In order to be able to see your Creatures on Highrise and receive all the perks and benefits, you need to connect your Metamask wallet to your Highrise account. Head to highrise.game and log in using your usual in-app login credentials for your Highrise account. Click over on your profile picture in the top right of the navigation bar. Then click on Settings. You‚Äôll see a section called Blockchain, press the Connect Metamask Wallet button. A Metamask popup will show up, press Sign. After that your Wallet will have been connected successfully. üéâ Now that you've integrated your crypto wallet, you'll be able to use your full creature outfit. That means that you can equip your NFT for a full creaturely vibe, or piece together your favorite elements to mix & match with other Highrise Items. Your Creature Club NFTs will appear on the second tab of your Highrise clothing inventory. ‚Äã You will automatically start receiving all the benefits and perks of owning a Highrise Creature for as long as your Metamask wallet containing at least one Highrise Creature remains connected to your Highrise account.",

        "category": "Creature Club",
        "content": "As a holder of Highrise Creature Club and Highrise LAND NFTs, it's important to stay vigilant against common scam tactics. Some common scam practices include: Impersonation of staff and/or trusted community members accounts in the Highrise Discord Server: ‚Äã ‚Äã Oftentimes, scammers will attempt to mimic profile photos, banners, and usernames of official staff accounts and/or well known members of the community. They will then attempt to reach out to you privately and ask that you to verify your NFT to ensure authenticity. They may also attempt to offer middleman services or offer assistance with the buying and selling of your NFT. All of which are common scam tactics. An example is listed below: Be sure to compare Discord usernames, Discord join dates and mutual servers. Always verify who you're speaking to within the Highrise Game to ensure you're communicating with the same person on Discord! Multibridge/Suspicious Links: ‚Äã ‚Äã When attempting to sell your Highrise Slime Blob or Highrise Creature through the Official listing sites (Immutable X Marketplace, Blur, or TokenTrove), someone may reach out and claim that they are attempting to purchase your asset but are unable to and instead, receive an error. They may attempt to convince you that you haven't updated your wallet and in order to go forward with the sale, you'll need to connect your wallet to a website such as MultiBridger and send you a screenshot that appears similar to the ones shown below: By going to this website and connecting your wallet, you are granting the scammer complete access and control. They will drain your wallet of all assets and funds, leaving you with nothing. Avoid connecting your wallet to any website that is sent to you via private message! Only use the Official links provided through the Official Highrise Discord Server or through the Highrise Creature Club and Land Helpshift guides in-app. False Collections: It's important to ensure that you're using the official links provided in the Official Highrise Discord Server or through the Highrise Creature Club and Land Helpshift guides in-app to protect yourself from false collections online. False collections are collections that look identical but don't actually provide you with the NFT and associated benefits. It's simply a screenshot from the official collection. You may notice false collections advertise for the Highrise Creature Club and Highrise Land NFTs on Opensea for a cheaper cost. The original Highrise Creature collection is stationed on a layer-two blockchain system such as Immutable X and TokenTrove. They are not available on Opensea. ‚Äã Any Highrise Creature Club collection that is listed on Opensea is fake and will result in the loss of your funds if purchased! ‚Äã Trust Trades: ‚Äã ‚Äã Trust Trades involve taking another person's word as a verbal promise to follow through with the terms that both parties agreed upon. This may include trusting that funds, in-game items, or an NFT will be sent  without the use of an Official Marketplace. Some players will involve a third party \"middleman\" to participate by holding the NFT and/or funds until the terms that are agreed upon by the buyer and seller is complete. Be cautious when choosing to participate in a Trust Trade. If using a middleman, make sure the middleman is legitamite by verifying who they are through the Highrise platform and not just within the Official Highrise Discord Server. ‚Äã ‚Äã Impersonation of staff accounts or trusted members of the community is very common! ‚Äã It's always best to purchase or sell your NFT using the official marketplaces outlined in the Official Highrise Discord Server or through the Highrise Creature Club and Land Helpshift guides in-app. ‚Äã By participating in trust trades, you risk being scammed. Although someone may appear trustworthy with other community members vouching for their authenticity, it's not unheard of for people to gain trust by establishing a good reputation and in turn, decide to start scamming later on. Sharing Private Keys or Seed Phrases: Be aware that sharing your private key or seed phrase is similar to sharing the password of your an account. By sharing your private key or seed phrase, you are granting full access to your wallet to allow for any funds of assets to be transferred out of your wallet and into a scammer's wallet. NEVER share your private key or seed phrase with anyone! It is not a requirement to buy, sell, or trade an NFT. Also, by allowing someone to create a wallet and give it to you also provides them permanent access to this wallet! ‚Äã If you ever suspect that your wallet may be compromised, immediately create a new wallet through Metamask and transfer all of your funds and NFTs to the new wallet! ‚Äã Recap: Be aware of impersonation accounts - always verify who you're speaking with. Do not click any links provided to you by another person. Always use the official links provided. Be aware of false NFT collections. Avoid participating in Trust Trades. Avoid sharing your private key and/or seed phrase with anyone.",

        "category": "Highrise LAND",
        "content": "‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Purchasing Highrise LAND is done at your own risk. Blockchain technology is still new and evolving, and there is a risk of scams and other malicious activities. Please stay informed about basic security measures, such as using strong passwords and two-factor authentication, and only use services from trusted sources. To purchase a Highrise LAND, you will need a Metamask wallet, crypto currency, and to be informed about the basic security measures of the blockchain technology. ‚Äã You can follow the steps below: Step 1: Create a Metamask Wallet A MetaMask wallet is like a digital bank account for your crypto currency. It allows you to store and manage your ETH (Ether) and other digital tokens in a secure, easy-to-use way. You can use your MetaMask wallet to purchase Highrise LAND and access all the perks and benefits that come with owning a plot of LAND. You should use a computer to use and create a MetaMask Wallet. It's the easiest and safest way. Follow these steps: Install the MetaMask browser extension from the official website ( https://metamask.io ) or from the Chrome Web Store. Click the MetaMask icon in your browser to open the extension. Click the \"Create a Wallet\" button on the welcome screen. Enter a strong password to protect your wallet and click \"Create\". Make sure to write down your password and store it in a safe place. Read and accept the terms of use and privacy policy, then click \"All Done\". You will be shown your MetaMask seed phrase, which is a series of 12-24 words that can be used to restore your wallet if you forget your password or lose access to your account. Write down your seed phrase and store it in a safe place. ‚ö†Ô∏è This seed phrase can give anyone permanent full access to your account. Losing it means losing access to your account. Anyone with access to it can also have access to all the assets stored in your wallet. No one will ever ask you to share this information unless they‚Äôre trying to scam you. Click the \"Next\" button to continue. You will be taken to your MetaMask wallet where you can view your accounts, transaction history, and other information. Step 2: Connect your wallet to OpenSea: OpenSea is the marketplace where the Highrise LAND can be purchased. Once you have created a Metamask wallet and added funds, you'll need to connect your wallet to OpenSea via a Metamask extension. Here‚Äôs how to connect your wallet to OpenSea: Visit https://opensea.io/ and click on the image of a wallet that's located in the top right corner of your screen. Press the \"Connect Wallet‚Äù  button. Choose the Metamask option. A Metamask popup will show up, press ‚ÄúNext‚Äù, and then ‚ÄúConnect‚Äù. Your Metamask wallet should now be connected to OpenSea. Step 3: Add Funds to Your Metamask Wallet: To purchase Highrise LAND on OpenSea, you first need to purchase ETH (the crypto currency used to purchase Highrise LAND) After your wallet has been connected to the OpenSea website ( https://opensea.io/ ), press the wallet icon located at the top right section of your screen and press ‚ÄúAdd funds‚Äù. The easiest way to add funds is using the first option: Credit Card. Simply choose how much ETH you want to buy, and follow the on-screen steps to checkout. After purchasing, your funds will be added to your Metamask wallet instantly. Alternatively, you can purchase ETH directly through MetaMask in some countries, or by using exchange apps such as Coinbase, Gemini, Moonpay, Shakepay, Binance, and Crypto.com . If you have purchased ETH using one of these alternatives, you will need to transfer the funds from the exchange wallet to your Metamask wallet to be able to use it. The exchange app will offer a transfer option in which you'll be required to input your MetaMask wallet address to send the funds. Note: Transferring ETH requires a small gas fee to process the transaction. To learn more about gas and gas fees, check out: https://defiprime.com/gas Step 4: Purchase a Plot of LAND: Choose the LAND plot that you would like to purchase from the OpenSea marketplace ( https://opensea.io/collection/highrise-land). Even if your preferred plot is not listed for sale, you can still submit an offer and the owner can then choose to accept or deny the offer. Press ‚ÄúAdd to cart‚Äù then click on the wallet icon shown in the top right section of your screen. From there, choose your preferred payment option and click \"Complete Purchase\" to instantly buy the LAND parcel. Alternatively, you may click  ‚ÄúMake an offer‚Äù if you would like to offer a different price to the owner of the LAND parcel. You will be prompted to follow a series of on-screen steps. ‚ö†Ô∏è Unlike Creatures which were launched through Immutable X [a layer two blockchain], false LAND Collections can exist on OpenSea.  To ensure you're accessing the correct LAND collection, only use the official link provided above! ‚ö†Ô∏è Step 5: Connect your Metamask wallet to your Highrise account: In order to be able to see your Slime-blob pet that is connected to your LAND, as well as receive all of the in-game perks and benefits, you'll need to connect your Metamask wallet to your Highrise account. Head to highrise.game and log in using your usual in-app login credentials for your Highrise account. Click over on your profile picture in the top right of the navigation bar. Then click on Settings. You‚Äôll see a section called Blockchain, press the Connect Metamask Wallet button. A Metamask popup will show up, press Sign. After that your Wallet will have been connected successfully. üéâ Now that you've integrated your crypto wallet, you'll be able to acquire in-game perks and benefits for owning a plot of LAND. This means that you'll be eligible to enter exclusive giveaways, receive random airdrops and even equip your Slime-blob pet to roam the Highrise universe at your side! Your Pet will appear in the first tab of your Highrise clothing inventory. ‚Äã ‚Äã You will automatically start receiving all of the benefits and perks for owning a plot of LAND  for as long as your Metamask wallet containing at least one plot remains connected to your Highrise account. Note: At this stage in the development of LAND, access to individual plots is not currently available to the owner. However, LAND owners will still acquire various in-game benefits by having their wallet with their LAND asset connected to Highrise!",

Creating an Estate gives you a few extra creative & promotional perks, including bigger rooms, customized thumbnails, and direct, personalized URL links to your world. Ready to start building? Getting Started First, make sure you have connected a wallet to your Highrise Account. You can find more details on how to connect ImmutableX to Highrise in the other FAQ in this segment, titled \" How do I create and link a wallet to my Highrise account? \" Second, check what kind of LAND you own: only L1 LAND is available for Estate creation. This means that your LAND parcel must live on the blockchain. Any LAND acquired using Highrise LAND Deeds was not originally minted on the blockchain, so it won't be eligible for Estate creation. Please note that gas fees are required in order to create your Estate. Third, note the quantity of LAND required for each Estate. Here are the available dimensions of LAND Estates and the parcels you'll need to create them: 3x3 6x6 9x9 12x12 Create your Estate Log in to highrise.game on web and navigate from the Inventory or Map to your LAND Info menu and hit \"Create Estate.\" Follow this link directly to the Estate creation page: https://highrise.game/estate/create Next, select which LAND parcels you'd like to use for your Estate in the Map view; parcels will be highlighted in black once selected. Once you're ready to go, hit Approve. Sign into MetaMask to Approve your Estate creation. After you've approved your Estate, you can feel free to leave the page while the request is processing. And... BAM! Come back to find yourself in possession of your very own Highrise Estate! Dissolve your Estate Not sure if you want Estate perks, or want to create an even bigger Estate using new LAND plots? Don't worry: you can dissolve your estate at any time. Head back to Inventory or Map and select the Estate you'd like to dissolve. Hit the Dissolve button. Next, sign into MetaMask to confirm the dissolution. Wow, wasn't that easy? . Add a Thumbnail We're all here for the customization, right? Give your Estate a custom thumbnail to give our Creature Island some spice! From within the Map or Inventory, select your Estate and select Edit Estate. Next, select Upload Photo Drag & drop or browse your files to find that perfect pic. You can use any of these formats - jpg, jpeg, png, or webp - but make sure your file is no larger than 90KB. Next, crop your image into a square and hit Upload > Save in order to finalize your thumbnail. Voila! You just got thumbnailed!",
