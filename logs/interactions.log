2024-12-01 21:54:32,165 - INFO - Chatbot Response: Did you ever dream of becoming a bubble mogul? Well, in Highrise, you can! Use these whimsical orbs to spin for rare items or jazz up your digital den. Here's how to inflate your bubble collection without blowing hot air: Goal Getter : Think of Daily Goals as your bubble-infused to-do list. Every time you check one off, we'll gift you bubbles. Finish them all? You're in for a bonus! Find these on the goals icon in your homeroom. Gift Grabber : Who said there's no such thing as free bubbles? Click the Bubbles icon in your homeroom for a daily gift. Feeling greedy? Watch some ads and we'll shower you with more! Crewmate's Charm : Crewmates are the friends who gift bubbles (and sometimes gold!) every time they buy some shiny stuff. Find these in your gifts section. Spare Seller : Duplicate items? Old stuff you don't need? Sell 'em for bubbles! You can even pawn untradeable items at the Welcome Plaza. It's like spring cleaning, but more lucrative! So, get out there and start bubble hunting. And remember, in Highrise, a bubble in the hand is worth two in the... well, anywhere!

There are two types: the gold Grab Token, which you can use to spin and trade the items you win, and the silver Promo Token, which gives you items that are bound to your account (no trading or transferring). If you run out of tokens, you can use gold for spins to keep the fun going. However, some grabs only accept gold or bubbles, so Grab Tokens won't work for those.

2024-12-02 01:13:40,172 - 2024-12-02T01:13:40.172730 - User: What are Directory Categories? | Chatbot: Directory Categories allow you to sort rooms into different categories and then view those categories in the room directory. There are currently three categories: Chat, Games, and Trade. Each of these categories is divided into subcategories: 

- Chat: Hangout, Roleplaying, Other 
- Games: Pageant, Color Run, Blocks, Cross the Line, Mafia, Races, Other 
- Trade: Auction, Storefront, User Grabs, Other 

Directory Categories do not affect gameplay, meaning you can continue to do whatever you want in these rooms. For example, you can still trade in a game room or host pageants in a trade room. The categories simply make it easier for you and other players to find rooms of interest. You can access the category menu when creating a new room or editing an existing room.

They serve as a shared clubhouse where crew members can collaborate on projects, hang out, and participate in build competitions. To create a Crew Room, you can go to the Room Directory, tap on "My Rooms," and then select the "Crew Rooms" tab. From there, you'll find the option to "Add Room." Each crew member co-owns the room, allowing everyone to contribute to its design while managing access and settings. Just remember, while you can move furniture around, only the owner can remove it!

You can filter your furniture and walls/floors using the icons next to 'all', or you can search for a specific item by typing its name in the search bar. Once you find the furniture you want, simply drag and drop it into your room to arrange it as you like. Enjoy decorating!
