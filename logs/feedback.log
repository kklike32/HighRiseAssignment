2024-12-02T01:20:41.897044 - User: what are crew rooms? | Chatbot: Crew Rooms are like your favorite hangout spot, customized by your crew. They serve as a shared clubhouse where crew members can collaborate on projects, hang out, and participate in build competitions. To create a Crew Room, you can go to the Room Directory, tap on "My Rooms," and then select the "Crew Rooms" tab. From there, you'll find the option to "Add Room." Each crew member co-owns the room, allowing everyone to contribute to its design while managing access and settings. Just remember, while you can move furniture around, only the owner can remove it! | Feedback: Helpful

Click the pencil and ruler icon in the top right corner of your screen. A menu will pop up at the bottom, showing your collection of furniture. You can filter your furniture and walls/floors using the icons next to 'all', or you can search for a specific item by typing its name in the search bar. Once you find the furniture you want, simply drag and drop it into your room to arrange it as you like. Enjoy decorating! | Feedback: Helpful

2024-12-02T10:43:26.991297 - User: what are second hand grabs? | Chatbot: Second-hand grabs are like your personal vending machines for grabs! You can place them in your room, fill them with your items, and let other players try their luck. You keep 70% of all the gold your machine earns. You can add or remove items whenever you want and set the draw price anywhere from 1 to 99,999 gold, as well as set the odds for different rarity levels (Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic, and Legendary). The probability percentage is always displayed, and if a specific rarity runs out, its odds get added to the lowest remaining rarity. You can also monitor your grab activity to see who drew from it and how much gold they spent. Visitors can view your username, check out the odds, draw from the grab, and receive notifications about your grab's status. | Feedback: Helpful
