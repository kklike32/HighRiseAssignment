They serve as a shared clubhouse where crew members can collaborate on projects, hang out, and participate in build competitions. To create a Crew Room, you can go to the Room Directory, tap on "My Rooms," and then select the "Crew Rooms" tab. From there, you'll find the option to "Add Room." Each crew member co-owns the room, allowing everyone to contribute to its design while managing access and settings. Just remember, while you can move furniture around, only the owner can remove it! | Feedback: Helpful

Click the pencil and ruler icon in the top right corner of your screen. A menu will pop up at the bottom, showing your collection of furniture. You can filter your furniture and walls/floors using the icons next to 'all', or you can search for a specific item by typing its name in the search bar. Once you find the furniture you want, simply drag and drop it into your room to arrange it as you like. Enjoy decorating! | Feedback: Helpful
